#Example data cleaning script 

#One script file for each data cleaning issue

#Read in the raw data from "data\data_collection\SCC Meta-Analysis Data Template_Revised"

#Process (e.g. write a script that standardizes model names) but don't write a new file

#We will have a master "clean.R" file that will do all the data cleaning steps in the right order and outputs a cleaned dataset
