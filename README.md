# Structural Determinants of the Social Cost of Carbon

This repository provides reproduction code and supplementary analysis
for the paper "Synthesis of evidence yields high social cost of carbon
due to structural model variation and uncertainties" by Moore et al.

## Organization of the Repository

The repository contains input data and the code used to perform the
analysis, as well as some outputs. The following directories are at
the root of the repository:

 - `data/`: Inputs (not generated by the code)
 - `figures/`: Output figures (generated by the code)
 - `saved-outputs/`: Output data (generated by the code), provided for
   convenience so they do not need to be regenerated.
 - `src/`: The code used to analyse the data

## Reproduction Process

### Preparing the `outputs` directory

You may either generate results from scratch (option 1) or use
pre-generated outputs (option 2).

For both approaches, start by creating an `outputs` directory in the
root directory of the repository.

#### Option 1: Create new outputs

TODO

#### Option 2: Pre-generated outputs

Copy the contents of `saved-outputs` to new `outputs` directory.

Download the results from
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MiwK6dKQWSTOG_3LINeixzGkbgWVR-pZ?usp=sharing]
and place these files in a directory named `Structural SCC RF
Experiments` within the `outputs` directory.
