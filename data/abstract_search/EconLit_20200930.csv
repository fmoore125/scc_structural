Untapped Fossil Fuel and the Green Paradox: A Classroom Calibration of the Optimal Carbon Tax,"A classroom model of global warming, fossil fuel depletion and the optimal carbon tax is formulated and calibrated. It features iso-elastic fossil fuel demand, stock-dependent fossil fuel extraction costs, an exogenous interest rate and no decay of the atmospheric stock of carbon. The optimal carbon tax reduces emissions from burning fossil fuel, both in the short and medium run. Furthermore, it brings forward the date that renewables take over from fossil fuel and encourages the market to keep more fossil fuel locked up. A renewables subsidy induces faster fossil fuel extraction and thus accelerates global warming during the fossil fuel phase, but brings forward the carbon-free era, locks up more fossil fuel reserves and thus ultimately curbs cumulative carbon emissions and global warming. For relatively large subsidies social welfare is more likely to fall as the economic costs rises more than proportionally with the size of the subsidy. Our calibration suggests that such subsidies are not a good second-best alternative for the carbon tax. Of course, such subsidies are required if markets fail to internalize learning-by-doing externalities in renewable production.",,1677363828, 1489841,Scholarly Journals,,"van der Ploeg, Frederick",," van der Ploeg, Frederick", 10.1007/s10018-014-0097-7, Journal Article, 1867-383X,"  0, 2015",,1432-847X,2, English, English, 185-210,"0, 2015",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,17,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1677363828?accountid=14505," Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, vol. 17, no. 2, 2015, pp. 185-210", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10018] Publisher's URL, 185," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q31) , Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Depletion , Externalities , Fuel , Subsidies , Subsidy , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Untapped+Fossil+Fuel+and+the+Green+Paradox%3A+A+Classroom+Calibration+of+the+Optimal+Carbon+Tax&amp;title=Environmental+Economics+and+Policy+Studies&amp;issn=1432847X&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=185&amp;au=van+der+Ploeg%2C+Frederick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+Economics+and+Policy+Studies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1489841&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10018-014-0097-7,EconLit
Increase in Carbon Prices: Analysis of Energy-Economy Modeling,"This study examines the mechanisms of social cost of carbon (SCC) and marginal abatement cost (MAC) in climate change modeling. To examine these mechanisms, we observed the shifts in the marginal benefit (MB) and marginal cost (MC) curves of carbon dioxide (CO2) abatement when parameter values are changed. In the observation, we used the DICE model proposed by Nordhaus (A question of balance: weighing the options on global warming policies. Yale University Press, New Haven, 2008) changing 24 parameters for the observation. In consequent, firstly, we have found that discount rate is not only one of the parameters which significantly raise the carbon price, that is, other parameters may have significant impact too. Secondly, we have found that there are two patterns in the rise of the SCC, and three patterns in the rise of the MAC. Thirdly, we have found that the difference between the rise of the SCC and MAC is primarily caused by the horizontal MB curve in CO2 emissions reduction; an upward shift of MC curve raises MAC but never raises the SCC. Thus, the choice of the SCC or MAC may make the change of carbon price different, affecting global warming policy.",,1677363916, 1489843,Scholarly Journals,,"Hatase, Kazushi;Managi, Shunsuke",," Hatase, Kazushi", 10.1007/s10018-014-0101-2, Journal Article, 1867-383X,"  0, 2015",,1432-847X,2, English, English, 241-262,"0, 2015",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,17,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1677363916?accountid=14505," Environmental Economics and Policy Studies, vol. 17, no. 2, 2015, pp. 241-62", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10018] Publisher's URL, 241," Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Energy",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Increase+in+Carbon+Prices%3A+Analysis+of+Energy-Economy+Modeling&amp;title=Environmental+Economics+and+Policy+Studies&amp;issn=1432847X&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=241&amp;au=Hatase%2C+Kazushi%3BManagi%2C+Shunsuke&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+Economics+and+Policy+Studies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1489843&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10018-014-0101-2,EconLit
A Portfolio Approach to Climate Investments: CAPM and Endogenous Risk,"Is there a role for investments in climate change mitigation despite low expected return? We use a model of intertemporal expected utility maximisation to analyse this question. Similar to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) the rate of return depends on the correlation of risk between the return on investments in climate change mitigation and the market portfolio, but in contrast to the classical CAPM we admit the fact that economic and environmental systems are jointly determined, implying that environmental risk is endogenous. Therefore, investments in climate change mitigation may reduce risk via self-protection and self-insurance. If risk reduction is accounted for in cost-benefit evaluations, climate investments may be justified despite low expected return. These aspects of climate investments are not, however, communicated via standard cost-benefit analyses of climate policy. Optimal climate policy may therefore be more ambitious than previously considered.",,56643465, 0929101,Scholarly Journals,,"Sandsmark, Maria;Vennemo, Haakon",," Sandsmark, Maria", 10.1007/s10640-006-9049-4, Journal Article, 1573-1502, August 2007,,0924-6460,4, English, English, 681-695,August 2007,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2007,, American Economic Association,37,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56643465?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 37, no. 4, August 2007, pp. 681-95", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 681," Asset Pricing, Trading Volume, Bond Interest Rates (G12) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Asset Pricing , CAPM , Capital Asset Pricing , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Portfolio+Approach+to+Climate+Investments%3A+CAPM+and+Endogenous+Risk&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2007-08-01&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=681&amp;au=Sandsmark%2C+Maria%3BVennemo%2C+Haakon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0929101&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-006-9049-4,EconLit
On the Uncertainty about the Total Economic Impact of Climate Change,"This paper uses a vote-counting procedure to estimate the probability density function of the total economic impact as a parabolic function of global warming. There is a wide range of uncertainty about the impact of climate change up to 3 degrees C, and the information becomes progressively more diffuse beyond that. Warming greater than 3 degrees C most likely has net negative impacts, and warming greater than 7 degrees C may lead to a total welfare loss. The expected value of the social cost of carbon is about $29/tC in 2015 and rises at roughly 2% per year.",,1081422230, 1321585,Scholarly Journals,,"Tol, Richard S J",," Tol, Richard S J", 10.1007/s10640-012-9549-3, Journal Article, 1573-1502, September 2012,,0924-6460,1, English, English, 97-116,September 2012,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2012,, American Economic Association,53,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1081422230?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 53, no. 1, September 2012, pp. 97-116", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 97," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=On+the+Uncertainty+about+the+Total+Economic+Impact+of+Climate+Change&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2012-09-01&amp;volume=53&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=97&amp;au=Tol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1321585&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-012-9549-3,EconLit
Epstein-Zin Utility in DICE: Is Risk Aversion Irrelevant to Climate Policy?,"Climate change involves uncertain probabilities of catastrophic risks, and very long-term consequences of current actions. Climate economics, therefore, is centrally concerned with the treatment of risk and time. Yet conventional assumptions about utility and optimal economic growth create a perverse connection between risk aversion and time preference, such that more aversion to current risks implies less concern for future outcomes, and vice versa. The same conflation of risk aversion and time preference leads to the equity premium puzzle in finance. A promising response to the equity premium puzzle, the recursive utility of Epstein and Zin, allows separation of risk aversion and time preference--at the cost of considerable analytic complexity. We introduce an accessible implementation of Epstein-Zin utility into the DICE model of climate economics, creating a hybrid ""EZ-DICE"" model. Using Epstein-Zin parameters from the finance literature and climate uncertainty parameters from the science literature, we find that the optimal climate policy in EZ-DICE calls for rapid abatement of carbon emissions; it is similar to standard DICE results with the discount rate set to equal the risk-free rate of return. EZ-DICE solutions are sensitive to the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, but remarkably insensitive to risk aversion. Insensitivity to risk aversion may reflect the difficulty of modeling catastrophic risks within DICE. Implicit in DICE are strong assumptions about the cost of climate stabilization and the certainty and speed of success; under these assumptions, risk aversion would in fact be unimportant. A more realistic analysis will require a subtler treatment of catastrophic climate risk.",,1438547825, 1392723,Scholarly Journals,,"Ackerman, Frank;Stanton, Elizabeth A;Bueno, Ramon",," Ackerman, Frank", 10.1007/s10640-013-9645-z, Journal Article, 1573-1502, September 2013,,0924-6460,1, English, English, 73-84,September 2013,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,56,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1438547825?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 56, no. 1, September 2013, pp. 73-84", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 73," Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Certainty , Climate , Probabilities , Risk , Risk Aversion , Uncertainty",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Epstein-Zin+Utility+in+DICE%3A+Is+Risk+Aversion+Irrelevant+to+Climate+Policy%3F&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=56&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=73&amp;au=Ackerman%2C+Frank%3BStanton%2C+Elizabeth+A%3BBueno%2C+Ramon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1392723&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-013-9645-z,EconLit
Climate Policy under Fat-Tailed Risk: An Application of Dice,"Uncertainty plays a significant role in evaluating climate policy, and fat-tailed uncertainty may dominate policy advice. Should we make our utmost effort to prevent the arbitrarily large impacts of climate change under deep uncertainty? In order to answer to this question, we propose a new way of investigating the impact of (fat-tailed) uncertainty on optimal climate policy: the curvature of the optimal carbon tax against the uncertainty. We find that the optimal carbon tax increases as the uncertainty about climate sensitivity increases, but it does not accelerate as implied by Weitzman's Dismal Theorem. We find the same result in a wide variety of sensitivity analyses. These results emphasize the importance of balancing the costs of climate change against its benefits, also under deep uncertainty.",,1492588635, 1407172,Scholarly Journals,,"Hwang, In Chang;Reynes, Frederic;Tol, Richard S J",,, 10.1007/s10640-013-9654-y, Journal Article, 1573-1502, November 2013,,0924-6460,3, English, English, 415-436,November 2013,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,56,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1492588635?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 56, no. 3, November 2013, pp. 415-36", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 415," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Policy+under+Fat-Tailed+Risk%3A+An+Application+of+Dice&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2013-11-01&amp;volume=56&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=415&amp;au=Hwang%2C+In+Chang%3BReynes%2C+Frederic%3BTol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1407172&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-013-9654-y,EconLit
Emissions Trading with Offset Markets and Free Quota Allocations,"We study optimal climate policy for a ""policy bloc"" of countries facing a market where emissions offsets can be purchased from a non-policy ""fringe"" of countries (such as with the CDM). Policy-bloc firms benefit from free quota allocations, which are updated according to either firms' past emissions, or outputs. We show that the resulting abatement and its allocation between policy bloc and fringe are both inefficient. When all quotas are traded freely at a single price, the policy bloc chooses to either not constrain the offset market, leading to suboptimal policy-bloc mitigation; or ban offsets completely. The former (latter) case occurs when free allocation of quotas is not (very) generous, and the offset market is large (small). It is preferable for policy-bloc countries' governments to instead buy offsets directly from the fringe at a quota price below marginal damage cost of emissions, while the policy-bloc quota price will be above this cost. With maximization of global welfare and a unified quota price, this price is higher, and offsets constrained in fewer cases, but the solution still inefficient. Full efficiency then requires a higher quota price in the policy bloc than in the fringe.",,1692273852, 1500830,Scholarly Journals,,"Rosendahl, Knut Einar;Strand, Jon",," Rosendahl, Knut Einar", 10.1007/s10640-014-9791-y, Journal Article, 1573-1502, June 2015,,0924-6460,2, English, English, 243-271,June 2015,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,61,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1692273852?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 61, no. 2, June 2015, pp. 243-71", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 243," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Emissions+Trading+with+Offset+Markets+and+Free+Quota+Allocations&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=61&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=243&amp;au=Rosendahl%2C+Knut+Einar%3BStrand%2C+Jon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1500830&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-014-9791-y,EconLit
Valuing the Ozone-Related Health Benefits of Methane Emission Controls,"Methane is a greenhouse gas that oxidizes to form ground-level ozone, itself a greenhouse gas and a health-harmful air pollutant. Reducing methane emissions will both slow anthropogenic climate change and reduce ozone-related mortality. We estimate the benefits of reducing methane emissions anywhere in the world for ozone-related premature mortality globally and for eight geographic regions. Our methods are consistent with those used by the US Government to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC). We find that the global short- and long-term premature mortality benefits due to reduced ozone production from methane mitigation are (2011) $790 and $1775 per tonne methane, respectively. These correspond to approximately 70 and 150% of the valuation of methane's global climate impacts using the SCC after extrapolating from carbon dioxide to methane using global warming potential estimates. Results for monetized benefits are sensitive to a number of factors, particularly the choice of elasticity to income growth used when calculating the value of a statistical life. The benefits increase for emission years further in the future. Regionally, most of the global mortality benefits accrue in Asia, but 10% accrue in the United States. This methodology can be used to assess the benefits of methane emission reductions anywhere in the world, including those achieved by national and multinational policies.",,1863198352, 1612182,Scholarly Journals,,"Sarofim, Marcus C;Waldhoff, Stephanie T;Anenberg, Susan C",," Sarofim, Marcus C", 10.1007/s10640-015-9937-6, Journal Article, 1573-1502, January 2017,,0924-6460,1, English, English, 45-63,January 2017,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,66,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1863198352?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 66, no. 1, January 2017, pp. 45-63", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 45," Health Behavior (I12) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate , Health , Mortality , Pollutant",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Valuing+the+Ozone-Related+Health+Benefits+of+Methane+Emission+Controls&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=66&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=45&amp;au=Sarofim%2C+Marcus+C%3BWaldhoff%2C+Stephanie+T%3BAnenberg%2C+Susan+C&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1612182&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-015-9937-6,EconLit
Prioritarianism and Climate Change,"Prioritarianism is the ethical view that gives greater weight to well-being changes affecting individuals at lower well-being levels. This view is influential both in moral philosophy, and in theoretical work on social choice--where it is captured by a social welfare function (""SWF"") summing a concave transformation of individual well-being numbers. However, prioritarianism has largely been ignored by scholarship on climate change. This Article compares utilitarianism and prioritarianism as frameworks for evaluating climate policy. It reviews the distinctive normative choices that are required for the prioritarian approach: specifying a ratio scale for well-being (if the prioritarian SWF takes the standard ""Atkinson"" form); determining the degree of concavity of the transformation function (i.e., the degree of social inequality aversion); and choosing between ""ex ante"" and ""ex post"" prioritarianism under conditions of risk. The Article also sketches some of salient implications of a prioritarian SWF for climate policy--with respect to the social cost of carbon, the social discount rate, optimal mitigation, and the ""dismal theorem.""

Environmental Protection for Sale: Strategic Green Industrial Policy and Climate Finance,"Industrial policy has long been criticized as subject to protectionist interests; accordingly, subsidies to domestic producers face disciplines under World Trade Organization agreements, without exceptions for environmental purposes. Now green industrial policy is gaining popularity as governments search for low-carbon solutions that also provide jobs at home. The strategic trade literature has largely ignored the issue of market failures related to green goods. I consider the market for a new environmental good (like low-carbon technology) whose downstream consumption provides external benefits (like reduced emissions). Governments may have some preference for supporting domestic production, such as by interest-group lobbying, introducing a political distortion in their objective function. I examine the national incentives and global rationales for offering production (upstream) and deployment (downstream) subsidies in producer countries, allowing that some of the downstream market may lie in nonregulating third-party countries. Restraints on upstream subsidies erode global welfare when environmental externalities are large enough relative to political distortions. Climate finance is an effective alternative if political distortions are large and governments do not undervalue carbon costs. Numerical simulations of the case of renewable energy indicate that a modest social cost of carbon can imply benefits from allowing upstream subsidies.",,1904180223, 1635764,Scholarly Journals,,"Fischer, Carolyn",," Fischer, Carolyn", 10.1007/s10640-016-0092-5, Journal Article, 1573-1502, March 2017,,0924-6460,3, English, English, 553-575,March 2017,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,66,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1904180223?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 66, no. 3, March 2017, pp. 553-75", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 553," Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior (D72) , Industrial Policy, Sectoral Planning Methods (L52) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Energy , Government , Industrial Policy , Interest Group , Lobbying , Political",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Environmental+Protection+for+Sale%3A+Strategic+Green+Industrial+Policy+and+Climate+Finance&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2017-03-01&amp;volume=66&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=553&amp;au=Fischer%2C+Carolyn&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1635764&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-016-0092-5,EconLit
Climate Engineering and Abatement: A 'Flat' Relationship under Uncertainty,"The potential of climate engineering to substitute or complement abatement of greenhouse gas emissions has been increasingly debated over the last years. The scientific assessment is driven to a large extent by assumptions regarding its effectiveness, costs, and impacts, all of which are profoundly uncertain. We investigate how this uncertainty about climate engineering affects the optimal abatement policy in the near term. Using a two period model of optimal climate policy under uncertainty, we show that although abatement decreases in the probability of success of climate engineering, this relationship is concave implying a rather 'flat' level of abatement as the probability of climate engineering becomes a viable policy option. Using a stochastic version of an integrated assessment model, the results are found to be robust to a wide range of specifications. Moreover, we numerically evaluate different correlation structures between climate engineering and the equilibrium climate sensitivity.",,2027572129, 1696315,Scholarly Journals,,"Emmerling, Johannes;Tavoni, Massimo",," Emmerling, Johannes", 10.1007/s10640-016-0104-5, Journal Article, 1573-1502, February 2018,,0924-6460,2, English, English, 395-415,February 2018,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,69,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2027572129?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 69, no. 2, February 2018, pp. 395-415", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 395," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Engineering+and+Abatement%3A+A+%27Flat%27+Relationship+under+Uncertainty&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2018-02-01&amp;volume=69&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=395&amp;au=Emmerling%2C+Johannes%3BTavoni%2C+Massimo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1696315&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-016-0104-5,EconLit
Optimum Growth and Carbon Policies with Lags in the Climate System,"We study the optimal carbon tax in an economy in which climate change, stemming from polluting non-renewable resource, affects the economy's growth potential. Our main contribution is to introduce and explore the natural time lag of the climate system between emissions and damages to capital accumulation in an endogenous growth setting. This allows us to investigate how optimal climate policy, and its interplay with climate dynamics, affect long-run growth and the transition of the economy towards it. Without pollution decay, a higher speed of emissions diffusion steepens the growth profile of the economy. With pollution decay, this leads to lower short-run but higher long-run economic growth during transition. Poor understanding of the emissions diffusion process leads to suboptimal carbon taxes, resource extraction and growth.",,2089842728, 1723320,Scholarly Journals,,"Bretschger, Lucas;Karydas, Christos",," Bretschger, Lucas", 10.1007/s10640-017-0153-4, Journal Article, 1573-1502, August 2018,,0924-6460,4, English, English, 781-806,August 2018,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,70,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2089842728?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 70, no. 4, August 2018, pp. 781-806", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 781," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Environment and Growth (O44) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Growth , Tax , Taxes",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimum+Growth+and+Carbon+Policies+with+Lags+in+the+Climate+System&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2018-08-01&amp;volume=70&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=781&amp;au=Bretschger%2C+Lucas%3BKarydas%2C+Christos&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1723320&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-017-0153-4,EconLit
Defining the Abatement Cost in Presence of Learning-by-Doing: Application to the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle,"We consider a partial equilibrium model to study the optimal phasing out of polluting goods by green goods. The unit production cost of the green goods involves convexity and learning-by-doing. The total cost for the social planner includes the private cost of production and the social cost of carbon, assumed to be exogenous and growing at the social discount rate. Under these assumptions the optimization problem can be decomposed in two questions: (i) when to launch a given schedule; (ii) at which rate the transition should be completed that is, the design of a transition schedule as such. The first question can be solved using a simple indicator interpreted as the MAC of the whole schedule, possibly non optimal. The case of hydrogen vehicle (Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles) offers an illustration of our results. Using data from the German market we show that the 2015-2050 trajectory foreseen by the industry would be consistent with a carbon price at 52Euro/t. The transition cost to achieve a 7.5 M car park in 2050 is estimated at 21.6 billion Euro that is, to JEl 4% discount rate, 115 Euro annually for each vehicle which would abate 2.18 tCO2 per year.",,2141015706, 1740330,Scholarly Journals,,"Creti, Anna;Kotelnikova, Alena;Meunier, Guy;Ponssard, Jean-Pierre",," Creti, Anna", 10.1007/s10640-017-0183-y, Journal Article, 1573-1502, November 2018,,0924-6460,3, English, English, 777-800,November 2018,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,71,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2141015706?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 71, no. 3, November 2018, pp. 777-800", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 777," Optimization Techniques, Programming Models, Dynamic Analysis (C61) , Automobiles, Other Transportation Equipment, Related Parts and Equipment (L62) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy Forecasting (Q47) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Germany , Europe , Car , Fuel , Optimization , Polluting , Vehicles",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Defining+the+Abatement+Cost+in+Presence+of+Learning-by-Doing%3A+Application+to+the+Fuel+Cell+Electric+Vehicle&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2018-11-01&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=777&amp;au=Creti%2C+Anna%3BKotelnikova%2C+Alena%3BMeunier%2C+Guy%3BPonssard%2C+Jean-Pierre&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1740330&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-017-0183-y,EconLit
Optimal Climate Policy for a Pessimistic Social Planner,"This paper characterizes the preferences of a pessimistic social planner concerned with the potential costs of extreme, low-probability climate events. This pessimistic attitude is represented by a recursive optimization criterion a la Hansen and Sargent (IEEE Trans Autom Control 40:968-971, 1995) implying that a very sharp and early mitigation effort arises as the optimal climate policy. We find that for sufficiently high levels of risk-aversion an aggressive mitigation policy is chosen even when the discount factor is low. The dynamics of the optimal mitigation policy displays an inverted policy ramp with a sharp and immediate mitigation effort, followed by a gradual reduction until the pollution stock converges towards its long-run equilibrium. We also observe that the initial sharpness of the mitigation effort requires substantial capture and sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere. We extend our analysis showing that when the social planner observes the concentration and emission levels with a time lag, she undertakes a more aggressive policy to reduce the greater degree of uncertainty she faces. Finally, we show under which conditions the optimal mitigation policy dictated by our analysis coincides with that derived using the robustness approach of Hansen and Sargent (Robustness, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008).",,2175320163, 1752674,Scholarly Journals,,"Valentini, Edilio;Vitale, Paolo",," Valentini, Edilio", 10.1007/s10640-017-0199-3, Journal Article, 1573-1502, February 2019,,0924-6460,2, English, English, 411-443,February 2019,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,72,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2175320163?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 72, no. 2, February 2019, pp. 411-43", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 411," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Pollution",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Climate+Policy+for+a+Pessimistic+Social+Planner&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2019-02-01&amp;volume=72&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=411&amp;au=Valentini%2C+Edilio%3BVitale%2C+Paolo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1752674&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-017-0199-3,EconLit
As Bad as It Gets: How Climate Damage Functions Affect Growth and the Social Cost of Carbon,"The paper analyzes the effects of varying climate impacts on the social cost of carbon and economic growth. We use polynomial damage functions in a model of an endogenously growing two-sector economy. The framework includes nonrenewable natural resources which cause greenhouse gas emissions; pollution stock harms capital and reduces economic growth. We find a big effect of the selected damage function on the social cost of carbon and a significant impact on the growth rate. In our calibration a quartic damage function raises the social cost of carbon by more than a factor of ten compared to the linear function. In the social optimum the growth rate remains positive even when the damage function is highly convex. We test the robustness of the results by adding pollution decay, lowering the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, and addressing uncertainty, which does not alter our results. We find that high marginal climate damages require stringent climate policies but do not preclude positive economic growth despite convexity, provided that policies are designed in an efficient manner.",,2175320464, 1752660,Scholarly Journals,,"Bretschger, Lucas;Pattakou, Aimilia",," Bretschger, Lucas", 10.1007/s10640-018-0219-y, Journal Article, 1573-1502, January 2019,,0924-6460,1, English, English, 5-26,January 2019,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,72,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2175320464?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 72, no. 1, January 2019, pp. 5-26", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 5," Macroeconomics: Production (E23) , Environment and Growth (O44) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Climate , Growth , Natural Resource , Pollution",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=As+Bad+as+It+Gets%3A+How+Climate+Damage+Functions+Affect+Growth+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=72&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=5&amp;au=Bretschger%2C+Lucas%3BPattakou%2C+Aimilia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1752660&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-018-0219-y,EconLit

Pricing Carbon and Adjusting Capital to Fend Off Climate Catastrophes,"The optimal reaction to a potential productivity shock as a consequence of climate tipping is to substantially tax carbon in order to curb the risk of tipping, but to adjust capital as well in order to smooth consumption when tipping occurs. We also allow for conventional marginal climate damages and decompose the optimal carbon tax in two catastrophe components and the conventional component. We distinguish constant and increasing marginal hazards. Moreover, the productivity catastrophe is compared with recoverable catastrophes and with a shock to the climate sensitivity. Finally, we allow for investments in adaptation capital as an alternative to counter the potential adverse effects of climate tipping.

Simple Rules for Climate Policy and Integrated Assessment,"A simple integrated assessment framework that gives rules for the optimal carbon price, transition to the carbon-free era and stranded carbon assets is presented, which highlights the ethical, economic, geophysical and political drivers of optimal climate policy. For the ethics we discuss the role of intergenerational inequality aversion and the discount rate, where we show the importance of lower discount rates for appraisal of longer run benefit and of policy makers using lower discount rates than private agents. The economics depends on the costs and rates of technical progress in production of fossil fuel, its substitute renewable energies and sequestration. The geophysics depends on the permanent and transient components of atmospheric carbon and the relatively fast temperature response, and we allow for positive feedbacks. The politics stems from international free-rider problems in absence of a global climate deal. We show how results change if different assumptions are made about each of the drivers of climate policy. Our main objective is to offer an easy back-on-the-envelope analysis, which can be used for teaching and communication with policy makers.",,2175319547, 1752664,Scholarly Journals,,"van der Ploeg, Frederick;Rezai, Armon",," van der Ploeg, Frederick", 10.1007/s10640-018-0280-6, Journal Article, 1573-1502, January 2019,,0924-6460,1, English, English, 77-108,January 2019,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,72,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2175319547?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 72, no. 1, January 2019, pp. 77-108", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 77," Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Technological Change: Choices and Consequences, Diffusion Processes (O33) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Technological Innovation (Q55) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , Climate , Free Rider , Fuel , Technical",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Simple+Rules+for+Climate+Policy+and+Integrated+Assessment&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=72&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=77&amp;au=van+der+Ploeg%2C+Frederick%3BRezai%2C+Armon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1752664&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-018-0280-6,EconLit
Active Learning and Optimal Climate Policy,"This paper develops a climate-economy model with uncertainty, irreversibility, and active learning. Whereas previous papers assume learning from one observation per period, or experiment with control variables to gain additional information, this paper considers active learning from investment in monitoring, specifically in improved observations of the global mean temperature. We find that the decision maker invests a significant amount of money in climate research, far more than the current level, in order to increase the rate of learning about climate change. This helps the decision maker make improved decisions. The level of uncertainty decreases more rapidly in the active learning model than in the passive learning model with only temperature observations. As the uncertainty about climate change is smaller, active learning reduces the optimal carbon tax. The greater the risk, the larger is the effect of learning. The method proposed here is applicable to any dynamic control problem where the quality of monitoring is a choice variable, for instance, the precision at which we observe GDP, unemployment, or the quality of education.",,2273741096, 1781128,Scholarly Journals,,"Hwang, In Chang;Tol, Richard S J;Hofkes, Marjan W",,, 10.1007/s10640-018-0297-x, Journal Article, 1573-1502, August 2019,,0924-6460,4, English, English, 1237-1264,August 2019,Environmental and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,73,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2273741096?accountid=14505," Environmental and Resource Economics, vol. 73, no. 4, August 2019, pp. 1237-64", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10640] Publisher's URL, 1237," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Active+Learning+and+Optimal+Climate+Policy&amp;title=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=09246460&amp;date=2019-08-01&amp;volume=73&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=1237&amp;au=Hwang%2C+In+Chang%3BTol%2C+Richard+S+J%3BHofkes%2C+Marjan+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environmental+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1781128&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10640-018-0297-x,EconLit
Determining the Social Cost of Carbon: Under Damage and Climate Sensitivity Uncertainty,"This article quantifies the impact on optimal climate policy, of both damage elasticity and equilibrium climate sensitivity uncertainty, under separable preferences for risk and intergenerational inequality. The primary findings are as follows. (1) Such preferences can depress the social cost of carbon (SCC) when calibration aims at matching actual economic outcomes, countering the prevailing view that the SCC is greater with separable than with conventional entangled preferences. (2) Damage elasticity uncertainty has larger effects on climate policy than equilibrium climate sensitivity uncertainty, even under high impact tail risk of the latter. (3) Risk aversion decisively strengthens optimal climate policy under joint damage and climate sensitivity uncertainty, than with a single source of uncertainty alone.

Battle for Climate and Scarcity Rents: Beyond the Linear-Quadratic Case,"Industria imports oil, produces final goods and wishes to mitigate global warming. Oilrabia exports oil and buys final goods from the other country. Industria uses the carbon tax to impose an import tariff on oil and steal some of Oilrabia's scarcity rent. Conversely, Oilrabia has monopoly power and sets the oil price to steal some of Industria's climate rent. We analyze the relative speeds of oil extraction and carbon accumulation under these strategic interactions for various production function specifications and compare these with the efficient and competitive outcomes. We prove that for the class of HARA production functions, the oil price is initially higher and subsequently lower in the open-loop Nash equilibrium than in the efficient outcome. The oil extraction rate is thus initially too low and in later stages too high. The HARA class includes linear, loglinear and semi-loglinear demand functions as special cases. For non-HARA production functions, Oilrabia may in the open-loop Nash equilibrium initially price oil lower than the efficient level, thus resulting in more oil extraction and climate damages. We also contrast the open-loop Nash and efficient outcomes numerically with the feedback Nash outcomes. We find that the optimal carbon tax path in the feedback Nash equilibrium is flatter than in the open-loop Nash equilibrium. It turns out that for certain demand functions using the carbon tax as an import tariff may hurt consumers' welfare as the resulting user cost of oil is so high that the fall in welfare wipes out the gain from higher tariff revenues.",,1751979946, 1534081,Scholarly Journals,,"Kagan, Mark;van der Ploeg, Frederick;Withagen, Cees",," Kagan, Mark", 10.1007/s13235-015-0154-2, Journal Article, 2153-0793, December 2015,,2153-0785,4, English, English, 493-522,December 2015,Dynamic Games and Applications," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,5,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751979946?accountid=14505," Dynamic Games and Applications, vol. 5, no. 4, December 2015, pp. 493-522", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/13235] Publisher's URL, 493," Game Theory and Bargaining Theory: General (C70) , Trade Policy, International Trade Organizations (F13) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Monopoly, Monopolization Strategies (L12) , Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate , Exports , Import , Monopoly , Oil , Oil Price , Revenue , Tariff , Tax , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Battle+for+Climate+and+Scarcity+Rents%3A+Beyond+the+Linear-Quadratic+Case&amp;title=Dynamic+Games+and+Applications&amp;issn=21530785&amp;date=2015-12-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=493&amp;au=Kagan%2C+Mark%3Bvan+der+Ploeg%2C+Frederick%3BWithagen%2C+Cees&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Dynamic+Games+and+Applications&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1534081&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs13235-015-0154-2,EconLit
Optimal Climate Policy Is a Utopia: From Quantitative to Qualitative Cost-Benefit Analysis,"The dominance of quantitative cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and optimality concepts in the economic analysis of climate policy is criticised. Among others, it is argued to be based in a misplaced interpretation of policy for a complex climate-economy system as being analogous to individual inter-temporal welfare optimisation. The transfer of quantitative CBA and optimality concepts reflects an overly ambitious approach that does more harm than good. An alternative approach is to focus the attention on extreme events, structural change and complexity. It is argued that a qualitative rather than a quantitative CBA that takes account of these aspects can support the adoption of a minimax regret approach or precautionary principle in climate policy. This means: implement stringent GHG reduction policies as soon as possible.",,56441532, 0772704,Scholarly Journals,,"van den Bergh, Jeroen C J M",,, 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2003.10.011, Journal Article,, April 2004,,0921-8009,4, English, English, 385-393,April 2004,Ecological Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2004,, American Economic Association,48,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56441532?accountid=14505," Ecological Economics, vol. 48, no. 4, April 2004, pp. 385-93", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09218009] Publisher's URL, 385," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Cost Benefit , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Climate+Policy+Is+a+Utopia%3A+From+Quantitative+to+Qualitative+Cost-Benefit+Analysis&amp;title=Ecological+Economics&amp;issn=09218009&amp;date=2004-04-01&amp;volume=48&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=385&amp;au=van+den+Bergh%2C+Jeroen+C+J+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Ecological+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0772704&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ecolecon.2003.10.011,EconLit
The Determination of Optimal Climate Policy,"Analyses of the costs and benefits of climate policy, such as the Stern Review, evaluate alternative strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by requiring that the cost of emission cuts in each and every year has to be covered by the associated value of avoided damage, discounted by a an exogenously chosen rate. An alternative is to optimize abatement programmes towards a stationary state, where the concentrations of greenhouse gases are stabilized and shadow prices, including the rate of discount, are determined endogenously. This paper examines the properties of optimized stabilization. It turns out that the implications for the evaluation of climate policy are substantial if compared with evaluations of the present value of costs and benefits based on exogenously chosen shadow prices. Comparisons of discounted costs and benefits tend to exaggerate the importance of the choice of discount rate, while ignoring the importance of future abatement costs, which turns out to be essential for the optimal abatement path. Numerical examples suggest that early action may be more beneficial than indicated by comparisons of costs and benefits discounted by a rate chosen on the basis of current observations.",,742796312, 1095459,Scholarly Journals,,"Aaheim, Asbjorn",," Aaheim, Asbjorn", 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.09.003, Journal Article,, January 2010,,0921-8009,3, English, English, 562-568,January 2010,Ecological Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2010,, American Economic Association,69,https://search.proquest.com/docview/742796312?accountid=14505," Ecological Economics, vol. 69, no. 3, January 2010, pp. 562-68", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09218009] Publisher's URL, 562," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Determination+of+Optimal+Climate+Policy&amp;title=Ecological+Economics&amp;issn=09218009&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=69&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=562&amp;au=Aaheim%2C+Asbjorn&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Ecological+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1095459&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ecolecon.2009.09.003,EconLit
CRED: A New Model of Climate and Development,"This paper describes a new model, Climate and Regional Economics of Development (CRED), which is designed to analyze the economics of climate and development choices. Its principal innovations are the treatment of global equity, calculation of the optimum interregional flows of resources, and use of McKinsey marginal abatement cost curves to project the cost of mitigation. The unconstrained, optimal climate policy in CRED involves very large capital flows from high-income to developing countries, to an extent that might be considered politically unrealistic. Under more realistic constraints, climate outcomes are generally worse; climate stabilization requires either moderate capital flows to developing countries, or a very low discount rate. In CRED, more equitable scenarios have better climate outcomes; the challenge of climate policy is to persuade high-income countries to accept the need for both international equity and climate protection. The paper ends with an agenda for further model development.

Climate Damages in the FUND Model: A Disaggregated Analysis,"We examine the treatment of climate damages in the FUND model. By inserting software switches to turn individual features on and off, we obtain FUND's estimates for 15 categories of damages, and for components of the agricultural category. FUND, as used by the U.S. government to estimate the social cost of carbon, projects a net benefit of climate change in agriculture, offset by a slightly larger estimate of all other damages. Within agriculture there is a large benefit from CO2 fertilization, a moderate cost from the effect of temperature on yields, and a much smaller impact of the rate of change. In FUND's agricultural modeling, the temperature-yield equation comes close to dividing by zero for high-probability values of a Monte Carlo parameter. The range of variation of the optimal temperature exceeds physically plausible limits, with 95% confidence intervals extending to 17 degrees C above and below current temperatures. Moreover, FUND's agricultural estimates are calibrated to research published in 1996 or earlier. Use of estimates from such models is arguably inappropriate for setting public policy. But as long as such models are being used in the policymaking process, an update to reflect newer research and correct modeling errors is needed before FUND's damage estimates can be relied on.",,1018333524, 1295430,Scholarly Journals,,"Ackerman, Frank;Munitz, Charles",," Ackerman, Frank", 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.03.005, Journal Article,, May 2012,,0921-8009,1, English, English, 219-224,May 2012,Ecological Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2012,, American Economic Association,77,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018333524?accountid=14505," Ecological Economics, vol. 77, no. 1, May 2012, pp. 219-24", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09218009] Publisher's URL, 219," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Damages+in+the+FUND+Model%3A+A+Disaggregated+Analysis&amp;title=Ecological+Economics&amp;issn=09218009&amp;date=2012-05-01&amp;volume=77&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=219&amp;au=Ackerman%2C+Frank%3BMunitz%2C+Charles&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Ecological+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1295430&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ecolecon.2012.03.005,EconLit
Monetary Valuation of the Social Cost of CO2 Emissions: A Critical Survey,"An expanding branch of research has estimated the potential costs of climate change, which are often expressed as the ""Social Cost of Carbon"" (SCC) or the costs of an additional ton of CO2 emissions. Estimates of the SCC can be used by policy makers to evaluate climate change policies and greenhouse gas emission reduction projects by means of cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). Such analyses are complicated by the wide range of SCC values that have been reported in the literature, and the large uncertainties involved in estimating the potential economic impacts and related costs of climate change. This study presents a critical review of the reported SCC estimates by examining some neglected consequences of climate change, uncertain and extreme scenarios of climate change, the discounting of future climate change effects, the treatment of individual risk aversion, and assumptions about social welfare. In view of the many uncertainties and omissions in conventional cost-benefit analyses of climate impacts and the SCC, alternative approaches to decision-making should be considered for climate policy.",,1692276296, 1500484,Scholarly Journals,,"van den Bergh, J C J M;Botzen, W J W",,, 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.03.015, Journal Article,, June 2015,,0921-8009,, English, English, 33-46,June 2015,Ecological Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,114,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1692276296?accountid=14505," Ecological Economics, vol. 114, June 2015, pp. 33-46", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09218009] Publisher's URL, 33," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Cost Benefit , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Monetary+Valuation+of+the+Social+Cost+of+CO2+Emissions%3A+A+Critical+Survey&amp;title=Ecological+Economics&amp;issn=09218009&amp;date=2015-06-01&amp;volume=114&amp;issue=&amp;spage=33&amp;au=van+den+Bergh%2C+J+C+J+M%3BBotzen%2C+W+J+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Ecological+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1500484&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ecolecon.2015.03.015,EconLit
The Changing Climate of Climate Change Economics,Climate change economics is now four decades old. Much of what it has achieved as a field of academic enquiry can be linked back to issues of integrated assessment modelling. This paper shows that the standard approach is going through a major change in scope as of the last five years. The conventional focus on determining optimal mitigation paths based on modelling the social cost of carbon is being enlarged to embrace promising new waves of research. These are: (1) the economics of insurance against catastrophic risks; (2) the economics of trade and climate; and (3) the economics of climate change adaptation. The paper helps to bridge the gap between economics and climate policy by showing that the analytical toolkit of climate change economics has shifted towards more realistic representations of climatic policy.,,1775618339, 1544958,Scholarly Journals,,"Vale, Petterson Molina",," Vale, Petterson Molina", 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.10.018, Journal Article,, January 2016,,0921-8009,, English, English, 12-19,January 2016,Ecological Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,121,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775618339?accountid=14505," Ecological Economics, vol. 121, January 2016, pp. 12-19", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09218009] Publisher's URL, 12," Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Changing+Climate+of+Climate+Change+Economics&amp;title=Ecological+Economics&amp;issn=09218009&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=121&amp;issue=&amp;spage=12&amp;au=Vale%2C+Petterson+Molina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Ecological+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1544958&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ecolecon.2015.10.018,EconLit
"Intertemporal Distribution, Sufficiency, and the Social Cost of Carbon","We explore how the intertemporal distribution of well-being affects the social cost of carbon. In contrast to the literature that studies parameters of a particular social welfare function, such as the discount rate, we shift the focus and directly assume a parametric form for the intertemporal distribution of well-being. This has the advantage of avoiding explicit discounting choices, which has initiated much debate. Specifically, we consider a set of intertemporal distributions that reach a steady-state at a pre-specified level of ""sufficient"" well-being, or equivalently after a pre-specified ""end-of-growth horizon"". We numerically illustrate our results in DICE and find that the social cost of carbon increases over-proportionally with the sufficiency level of well-being. While the social cost of carbon in 2015 is US$7 if the sufficiency level is four-fold the present level, it is US$30 if the sufficiency level is 15-fold, and US$100 if the sufficiency level is 26-fold the present level. This shows in a transparent way how conceptions of intergenerational distributive justice drive the social cost of carbon.",,2032390035, 1698036,Scholarly Journals,,"Hansel, Martin C;Quaas, Martin F",," Hansel, Martin C", 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.11.024, Journal Article,, April 2018,,0921-8009,, English, English, 520-535,April 2018,Ecological Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,146,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2032390035?accountid=14505," Ecological Economics, vol. 146, April 2018, pp. 520-35", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09218009] Publisher's URL, 520," General Welfare, Well-Being (I31) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , U.S. , Northern America , Welfare , Well Being , Well-being",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Intertemporal+Distribution%2C+Sufficiency%2C+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Ecological+Economics&amp;issn=09218009&amp;date=2018-04-01&amp;volume=146&amp;issue=&amp;spage=520&amp;au=Hansel%2C+Martin+C%3BQuaas%2C+Martin+F&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Ecological+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1698036&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ecolecon.2017.11.024,EconLit
Estimating the Societal Benefits of Carbon Dioxide Sequestration through Peatland Restoration,"The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (GDS) is a forested peatland that provides a number of ecosystem services including carbon (C) sequestration. We modeled and analyzed the potential capacity of the GDS to sequester C under four management scenarios: no management, no management with catastrophic fire, current management, and increased management. The analysis uses the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator developed for the GDS to estimate net ecosystem C balance. The model simulates net C gains and losses on an annual time-step from 2013 through 2062 which is converted to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) and monetized using the Interagency Working Group's Social Cost of Carbon. Our analysis incorporates compounded uncertainty including variation in ecological processes, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, and uncertainty in the discount rate. The no management scenario results in 2.4 million tons of CO2 emissions with a Net Present Value (NPV) under a 3% discount rate of -$67 million. No management with catastrophic fires emits 6.5 million tons of CO2 with an NPV of -$232 million. Current management avoids 9.9 million tons of emissions (via sequestration) with an NPV of $326 million. Increased management avoids 16.5 million tons of emissions with an NPV of $524 million.",,2118301525, 1731038,Scholarly Journals,,"Pindilli, Emily;Sleeter, Rachel;Hogan, Dianna",," Pindilli, Emily", 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.08.002, Journal Article,, December 2018,,0921-8009,, English, English, 145-155,December 2018,Ecological Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,154,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2118301525?accountid=14505," Ecological Economics, vol. 154, December 2018, pp. 145-55", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09218009] Publisher's URL, 145," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Services, Biodiversity Conservation, Bioeconomics, Industrial Ecology (Q57) , Ecological , Ecosystem , Wildlife",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Estimating+the+Societal+Benefits+of+Carbon+Dioxide+Sequestration+through+Peatland+Restoration&amp;title=Ecological+Economics&amp;issn=09218009&amp;date=2018-12-01&amp;volume=154&amp;issue=&amp;spage=145&amp;au=Pindilli%2C+Emily%3BSleeter%2C+Rachel%3BHogan%2C+Dianna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Ecological+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1731038&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ecolecon.2018.08.002,EconLit
How Sensitive Is Nordhaus to Weitzman? Climate Policy in DICE with an Alternative Damage Function,The damage function in the famous climate-economy model DICE has received much criticism. Weitzman (2010) has proposed an alternative approach that gives more serious attention to climate change impacts for larger temperature increases. We calculate optimal climate policy with DICE using this approach. Optimal emission abatement trajectories turn out to be very sensitive to the damage specification.

Climate Policy with Bentham-Rawls Preferences,"A Bentham-Rawls welfare function is the weighted sum of the net present welfare (Bentham) and the welfare of the worst-off generation (Rawls). If utility is non-decreasing over time, optimal climate policy is more stringent in the near-term under the Bentham criterion than under the Bentham-Rawls criterion. If utility is decreasing, Bentham-Rawls abatement is higher. If there is a chance of decreasing utility, Bentham-Rawls optimal climate policy is probably less stringent than Bentham policy.",,1322234183, 1353917,Scholarly Journals,,"Tol, Richard S J",," Tol, Richard S J", 10.1016/j.econlet.2012.12.006, Journal Article,, March 2013,,0165-1765,3, English, English, 424-428,March 2013,Economics Letters," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,118,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1322234183?accountid=14505," Economics Letters, vol. 118, no. 3, March 2013, pp. 424-28", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01651765] Publisher's URL, 424," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Policy+with+Bentham-Rawls+Preferences&amp;title=Economics+Letters&amp;issn=01651765&amp;date=2013-03-01&amp;volume=118&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=424&amp;au=Tol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics+Letters&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1353917&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.econlet.2012.12.006,EconLit
Optimal Climate Policy: Uncertainty versus Monte Carlo,"The integrated assessment literature frequently replicates uncertainty by averaging Monte Carlo runs of deterministic models. This Monte Carlo analysis is, in essence, an averaged sensitivity analyses. The approach resolves all uncertainty before the first time period, drawing parameters from a distribution before initiating a given model run. This paper analyzes how closely a Monte Carlo based derivation of optimal policies is to the truly optimal policy, in which the decision maker acknowledges the full set of possible future trajectories in every period. Our analysis uses a stochastic dynamic programming version of the widespread integrated assessment model DICE, and focuses on damage uncertainty. We show that the optimizing Monte Carlo approach is not only off in magnitude, but can even lead to a wrong sign of the uncertainty effect. Moreover, it can lead to contradictory policy advice, suggesting a more stringent climate policy in terms of the abatement rate and a less stringent one in terms of the expenditure on abatement.",,1438549961, 1392498,Scholarly Journals,,"Crost, Benjamin;Traeger, Christian P",," Crost, Benjamin", 10.1016/j.econlet.2013.05.019, Journal Article,, September 2013,,0165-1765,3, English, English, 552-558,September 2013,Economics Letters," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,120,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1438549961?accountid=14505," Economics Letters, vol. 120, no. 3, September 2013, pp. 552-58", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01651765] Publisher's URL, 552," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Climate+Policy%3A+Uncertainty+versus+Monte+Carlo&amp;title=Economics+Letters&amp;issn=01651765&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=120&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=552&amp;au=Crost%2C+Benjamin%3BTraeger%2C+Christian+P&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics+Letters&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1392498&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.econlet.2013.05.019,EconLit
The Social Cost of Carbon Emissions: Seven Propositions,"Determining the social cost of carbon emissions (SCC) is a crucial step in the economic analysis of climate change policy as the US government's recent decision to use a range of estimates of the SCC centered at $77/tC (or, equivalently, $21/tCO2) in cost-benefit analyses of proposed emission-control legislation underlines. This note reviews the welfare economics theory fundamental to the estimation of the SCC in both static and intertemporal contexts, examining the effects of assumptions about the typical agent's pure rate of time preference and elasticity of marginal felicity of consumption, production, and mitigation technology, and the magnitude of climate-change damage on estimates of the SCC. We highlight three key conclusions: (i) an estimate of the SCC is conditional on a specific policy scenario, the details of which must be made explicit for the estimate to be meaningful; (ii) the social discount rate relevant to intertemporal allocation decisions also depends on the policy scenario; and (iii) the SCC is uniquely defined only for policy scenarios that lead to an efficient growth path because marginal costs and benefits of emission-mitigation diverge on inefficient growth paths. We illustrate these analytical conclusions with simulations of a growth model calibrated to the world economy.",,1466580630, 1398450,Scholarly Journals,,"Foley, Duncan K;Rezai, Armon;Taylor, Lance",," Foley, Duncan K", 10.1016/j.econlet.2013.07.006, Journal Article,, October 2013,,0165-1765,1, English, English, 90-97,October 2013,Economics Letters," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,121,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1466580630?accountid=14505," Economics Letters, vol. 121, no. 1, October 2013, pp. 90-97", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01651765] Publisher's URL, 90," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , U.S. , Northern America , Allocation , Climate , Cost Benefit , Welfare , Welfare Economic",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+Emissions%3A+Seven+Propositions&amp;title=Economics+Letters&amp;issn=01651765&amp;date=2013-10-01&amp;volume=121&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=90&amp;au=Foley%2C+Duncan+K%3BRezai%2C+Armon%3BTaylor%2C+Lance&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics+Letters&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1398450&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.econlet.2013.07.006,EconLit
Robustness of a Simple Rule for the Social Cost of Carbon,"The optimal social cost of carbon is in general equilibrium proportional to GDP if utility is logarithmic, production is Cobb-Douglas, depreciation is 100% every period, climate damages as fraction of production decline exponentially with the stock of atmospheric carbon, and fossil fuel extraction does not require capital. The time profile and size of the optimal carbon tax corresponding to this simple rule are not robust to more convex climate damages, smaller elasticities of factor substitution and non-unitary coefficients of relative intergenerational inequality aversion. The optimal timing of energy transitions and the amount of fossil fuel reserves to be locked up in the earth are also not accurately predicted by this framework.

Climate Policy vs. Agricultural Productivity Shocks in a Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Modeling Framework: The Case of a Developing Economy,"The main objective of this paper is to compare the cost of climate policy consistent with the 2 degrees celsius global warming target (Paris Agreement target) with the cost of climate change induced agricultural productivity shocks, using a recursive dynamic CGE model for India. The social cost of carbon, in terms of loss in agriculture sector, is estimated to be about 2 percent of GDP, at zero rate of discount, under conservative forecasts of fall in agricultural productivity. In comparison, the cost of climate policy consistent with the Paris Agreement target of 2 degrees celsius is about 1 percent of GDP. Thus, there is a strong case for the adoption of ambitious climate policy in India, provided other countries also adhere to the same. Besides, revenues generated from the carbon tax and emission allowance could be a means to support the development and adoption of new energy and agricultural technologies, to increase social sector expenditure and to reduce abatement costs.",,2220205214, 1766485,Scholarly Journals,,"Pradhan, Basanta K;Ghosh, Joydeep",," Pradhan, Basanta K", 10.1016/j.econmod.2018.05.019, Journal Article,, March 2019,,0264-9993,, English, English, 55-69,March 2019,Economic Modelling," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,77,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2220205214?accountid=14505," Economic Modelling, vol. 77, March 2019, pp. 55-69", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/02649993] Publisher's URL, 55," Computable General Equilibrium Models (C68) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Formal and Informal Sectors, Shadow Economy, Institutional Arrangements (O17) , Agriculture: Aggregate Supply and Demand Analysis, Prices (Q11) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , India , Asia , Agricultural Productivity , Agriculture , CGE , Climate , Computable General Equilibrium , Development , Energy , GDP , Productivity , Revenue , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Policy+vs.+Agricultural+Productivity+Shocks+in+a+Dynamic+Computable+General+Equilibrium+%28CGE%29+Modeling+Framework%3A+The+Case+of+a+Developing+Economy&amp;title=Economic+Modelling&amp;issn=02649993&amp;date=2019-03-01&amp;volume=77&amp;issue=&amp;spage=55&amp;au=Pradhan%2C+Basanta+K%3BGhosh%2C+Joydeep&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economic+Modelling&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1766485&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.econmod.2018.05.019,EconLit
"Discount Rates, Equity Weights and the Social Cost of Carbon","Equity weighting has been proposed as a way of allowing welfare equivalents to be included in the social cost of carbon since a dollar to a poor person is worth more than a dollar to a rich one. Here we use the PAGE2002 integrated assessment model to show that the social cost of carbon is higher without equity weights (an elasticity of marginal utility with respect to income of 0) than with them. This might seem counter-intuitive, but it comes about because of the logical link between equity weights and discount rates; as the elasticity goes from 0 to -0.5 to -1.0, the social rate of time preference rises, and the drop in present values that results far outweighs the small increase in impacts that equity weights bring.",,56821764, 0967292,Scholarly Journals,,"Hope, Chris",," Hope, Chris", 10.1016/j.eneco.2006.11.006, Journal Article,, May 2008,,0140-9883,3, English, English, 1011-1019,May 2008,Energy Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2008,, American Economic Association,30,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56821764?accountid=14505," Energy Economics, vol. 30, no. 3, May 2008, pp. 1011-19", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01409883] Publisher's URL, 1011," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Discount+Rates%2C+Equity+Weights+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Energy+Economics&amp;issn=01409883&amp;date=2008-05-01&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=1011&amp;au=Hope%2C+Chris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0967292&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.eneco.2006.11.006,EconLit
Climate Policy and Induced R&amp;D: How Great Is the Effect?,"Carbon taxes or tradable permit systems to address climate change may induce research and development in energy-related technologies. We construct a single-knowledge-stock model of R&D, growth and climate to assess the importance of this effect. The contribution of induced R&D is shown to be very sensitive to (i) the duplication externality, (ii) the feasibility of dedicated research subsidies to internalize inter-firm knowledge spillovers, (iii) the opportunity cost of R&D, (iv) the initial level of research expenditure, and (v) the elasticity of substitution between energy and other factors of production. In contrast, the direction and scale of the inter-temporal research spillover are of secondary importance. We find strong support for Rezai's (2011) argument that, when the business-as-usual scenario (no policy) is modeled appropriately (all externalities treated as external), sacrifices for early generations associated with optimal climate policy are minor or non-existent. Employing our preferred selections for the parameters, we find that adding an induced R&D component to the model increases the welfare impact of the first-best policy (optimally chosen carbon tax and research subsidies) by an average value of more than 400%, and of the second-best policy (carbon tax alone) by approximately 22%.",,1650521953, 1472533,Scholarly Journals,,"Shiell, Leslie;Lyssenko, Nikita",," Shiell, Leslie", 10.1016/j.eneco.2014.09.017, Journal Article,, November 2014,,0140-9883,, English, English, 279-294,November 2014,Energy Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,46,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1650521953?accountid=14505," Energy Economics, vol. 46, November 2014, pp. 279-94", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01409883] Publisher's URL, 279," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Management of Technological Innovation and R&D (O32) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Externalities , Externality , R?

Selective Reporting and the Social Cost of Carbon,"We examine potential selective reporting (publication bias) in the literature on the social cost of carbon (SCC) by conducting a meta-analysis of 809 estimates of the SCC reported in 101 studies. Our results indicate that estimates for which the 95% confidence interval includes zero are less likely to be reported than estimates excluding negative values of the SCC, which might create an upward bias in the literature. The evidence for selective reporting is stronger for studies published in peer-reviewed journals than for unpublished papers. We show that the findings are not driven by the asymmetry of the confidence intervals surrounding the SCC and are robust to controlling for various characteristics of study design and to alternative definitions of confidence intervals. Our estimates of the mean reported SCC corrected for the selective reporting bias range between USD 0 and 134 per ton of carbon at 2010 prices for emission year 2015.",,1737998236, 1528390,Scholarly Journals,,"Havranek, Tomas;Irsova, Zuzana;Janda, Karel;Zilberman, David",," Havranek, Tomas", 10.1016/j.eneco.2015.08.009, Journal Article,, September 2015,,0140-9883,, English, English, 394-406,September 2015,Energy Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,51,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1737998236?accountid=14505," Energy Economics, vol. 51, September 2015, pp. 394-406", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01409883] Publisher's URL, 394," Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Selective+Reporting+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Energy+Economics&amp;issn=01409883&amp;date=2015-09-01&amp;volume=51&amp;issue=&amp;spage=394&amp;au=Havranek%2C+Tomas%3BIrsova%2C+Zuzana%3BJanda%2C+Karel%3BZilberman%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1528390&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.eneco.2015.08.009,EconLit
"Consequences of a Carbon Tax on Household Electricity Use and Cost, Carbon Emissions, and Economics of Household Solar and Wind","The study was conducted to determine the consequences of a carbon tax, equal to an estimated social cost of carbon of $37.2/Mg, on household electricity cost, and to determine if a carbon tax would be sufficient to incentivize households to install either a grid-tied solar or wind system. U.S. Department of Energy hourly residential profiles for five locations, 20years of hourly weather data, prevailing electricity pricing rate schedules, and purchase prices and solar panel and wind turbine power output response functions, were used to address the objectives. Two commercially available household solar panels (4kW, 12kW), two wind turbines (6kW, 12kW), and two price rate structures (traditional meter, smart meter) were considered. Averaged across the five households, the carbon tax is expected to reduce annual consumption by 4.4% (552kWh/year) for traditional meter households and by 4.9% (611kWh/year) for households charged smart meter rates. The carbon tax increases electricity cost by 19% ($202/year). For a household cost of $202/year the carbon tax is expected to reduce social costs by $11. Annual carbon tax collections of $234/household are expected. Adding the carbon tax was found to be insufficient to incentivize households to install either a solar panel or wind turbine system. Installation of a 4kW solar system would increase the annual cost by $1546 (247%) and decrease CO2 emissions by 38% (2526kg) valued at $94/household. The consequence of a carbon tax would depend largely on how the proceeds of the tax are used.",,2001401440, 1680599,Scholarly Journals,,"Ghaith, Ahmad F;Epplin, Francis M",," Ghaith, Ahmad F", 10.1016/j.eneco.2017.08.012, Journal Article,, September 2017,,0140-9883,, English, English, 159-168,September 2017,Energy Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,67,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2001401440?accountid=14505," Energy Economics, vol. 67, September 2017, pp. 159-68", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01409883] Publisher's URL, 159," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Electric Utilities (L94) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , U.S. , Northern America , Electricity , Energy , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Consequences+of+a+Carbon+Tax+on+Household+Electricity+Use+and+Cost%2C+Carbon+Emissions%2C+and+Economics+of+Household+Solar+and+Wind&amp;title=Energy+Economics&amp;issn=01409883&amp;date=2017-09-01&amp;volume=67&amp;issue=&amp;spage=159&amp;au=Ghaith%2C+Ahmad+F%3BEpplin%2C+Francis+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1680599&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.eneco.2017.08.012,EconLit
Climate Policies under Climate Model Uncertainty: Max-Min and Min-Max Regret,"Temperature responses and optimal climate policies depend crucially on the choice of a particular climate model. To illustrate, the temperature responses to given emission reduction paths implied by the climate modules of the well-known integrated assessments models DICE, FUND and PAGE are described and compared. A dummy temperature module based on the climate denialists' view is added. Using a simple welfare-maximising growth model of the global economy, the sensitivity of the optimal carbon price, renewable energy subsidy and energy transition to each of these climate models is discussed. The paper then derives max-min, max-max and min-max regret policies to deal with this particular form of climate (model) uncertainty and with climate scepticism. The max-min or min-max regret climate policies rely on a non-sceptic view of global warming and lead to a substantial and moderate amount of caution, respectively.

The Costs of Charging Plug-In Electric Vehicles (PEVs): Within Day Variation in Emissions and Electricity Prices,"The social costs of charging plug-in electrical vehicles (PEVs) that vary by times of day and by levels of emissions in electricity production are investigated. Using data available for the Sacramento area in the United States for 2013, we estimate marginal emission rates of electricity and marginal price of electricity provided for charging PEVs at different times of the day. As the marginal emission rates and wholesale electricity price have different daily patterns, there is a trade-off between emission and charging cost. Moreover, the estimates in the literature of the social costs for the most important emission, CO2, vary substantially, implying that the social cost of charging PEVs vary with the assumed cost. Simulations show that the charging time of lowest social costs for PEVs is found to be at midnight if the social cost of CO2 is not very high (<$90/ton), however, we find this pattern changes with an increase in the social cost of CO2. A high price of CO2 tends to shift the time of lowest social costs of charging to other times of day, thus, charging at workplaces during the daytime rather than at home overnight can reduce the social cost of charging PEVs.",,2024462288, 1694764,Scholarly Journals,,"Fang, Yingkai;Asche, Frank;Novan, Kevin",," Fang, Yingkai", 10.1016/j.eneco.2017.11.011, Journal Article,, January 2018,,0140-9883,, English, English, 196-203,January 2018,Energy Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,69,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2024462288?accountid=14505," Energy Economics, vol. 69, January 2018, pp. 196-203", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01409883] Publisher's URL, 196," Production, Pricing, and Market Structure, Size Distribution of Firms (L11) , Automobiles, Other Transportation Equipment, Related Parts and Equipment (L62) , Electric Utilities (L94) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , U.S. , Northern America , Electricity , Prices , Production , Vehicles",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Costs+of+Charging+Plug-In+Electric+Vehicles+%28PEVs%29%3A+Within+Day+Variation+in+Emissions+and+Electricity+Prices&amp;title=Energy+Economics&amp;issn=01409883&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=69&amp;issue=&amp;spage=196&amp;au=Fang%2C+Yingkai%3BAsche%2C+Frank%3BNovan%2C+Kevin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1694764&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.eneco.2017.11.011,EconLit
Estimating the Social Cost of Non-CO2 GHG Emissions: Methane and Nitrous Oxide,"Many estimates of the social cost of CO2 emissions (SCCO2) can be found in the climate economics literature. However, to date few estimates of the social costs of other greenhouse gases have been published, and most are not comparable to current estimates of the SCCO2. We construct an integrated assessment model that combines MAGICC and economic components from DICE to estimate the social costs of CO2, CH4, and N2O for the years 2010-2050, using assumptions similar to the recent U.S. government interagency SCC working group. We compare our estimates of the social costs for non-CO2 gases to those produced using the SCCO2 to value ""CO2-equivalent"" emissions, calculated using global warming potentials (GWPs). We examine the estimation error associated with using GWPs for single- and multi-gas abatement policies. In both cases, the error can be large, so estimates of the social costs of these gases should be used whenever possible. However, if direct estimates are not available, the value of reductions estimated using GWPs will typically have lower absolute errors than default estimates of zero, and provide lower bounds of the abatement benefits.",,1284056147, 1342468,Scholarly Journals,,"Marten, Alex L;Newbold, Stephen C",," Marten, Alex L", 10.1016/j.enpol.2012.09.073, Journal Article,, December 2012,,0301-4215,1, English, English, 957-972,December 2012,Energy Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2012,, American Economic Association,51,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1284056147?accountid=14505," Energy Policy, vol. 51, no. 1, December 2012, pp. 957-72", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03014215] Publisher's URL, 957," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Estimating+the+Social+Cost+of+Non-CO2+GHG+Emissions%3A+Methane+and+Nitrous+Oxide&amp;title=Energy+Policy&amp;issn=03014215&amp;date=2012-12-01&amp;volume=51&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=957&amp;au=Marten%2C+Alex+L%3BNewbold%2C+Stephen+C&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1342468&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.enpol.2012.09.073,EconLit
Supplying Synthetic Crude Oil from Canadian Oil Sands: A Comparative Study of the Costs and CO2 Emissions of Mining and In-Situ Recovery,"High crude oil prices and the eventual decline of conventional oil production raise the issue of alternative fuels such as non-conventional oil. The paper describes a simple probabilistic model of the costs of synthetic crude oil produced from Canadian oil sands. Synthetic crude oil is obtained by upgrading bitumen that is first produced through mining or in-situ recovery techniques. This forward-looking analysis quantifies the effects of learning and production constraints on the costs of supplying synthetic crude oil. The sensitivity analysis shows that before 2035, the most influential parameters are the learning parameter in the case of in-situ bitumen and the depletion parameter in the case of mined bitumen. After 2035, depletion dominates in both cases. The results show that the social cost of CO2 has a large impact on the total costs of synthetic crude oil, in particular in the case of synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen, due to the carbon intensity of the recovery techniques: taking into account the social cost of CO2 adds more than half to the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from mined bitumen in 2050 (mean value), while the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen more than doubles.",,1438548268, 1392596,Scholarly Journals,,"Mejean, Aurelie;Hope, Chris",," Mejean, Aurelie", 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.05.003, Journal Article,, September 2013,,0301-4215,, English, English, 27-40,September 2013,Energy Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,60,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1438548268?accountid=14505," Energy Policy, vol. 60, September 2013, pp. 27-40", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03014215] Publisher's URL, 27," Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels (L71) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Canada , Northern America , Crude Oil , Fuel , Mining , Oil , Oil Price",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Supplying+Synthetic+Crude+Oil+from+Canadian+Oil+Sands%3A+A+Comparative+Study+of+the+Costs+and+CO2+Emissions+of+Mining+and+In-Situ+Recovery&amp;title=Energy+Policy&amp;issn=03014215&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=60&amp;issue=&amp;spage=27&amp;au=Mejean%2C+Aurelie%3BHope%2C+Chris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1392596&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.enpol.2013.05.003,EconLit
Climate Change and Intergenerational Equity: Revisiting the Uniform Taxation Principle on Carbon Energy Inputs,"This paper presents a neoclassical growth model with three energy sectors and a climate externality. Energy is used in the production of the final consumption good. The energy sectors differ on the exhaustibility of the energy resource. Oil is an exhaustible resource, coal is an abundant resource, and a green energy sector uses labor. Oil and coal use increases the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, which generates a climate externality. Standard Pigouvian taxation prescribes that a uniform tax on all carbon energy inputs is optimal. This uniform tax must be equal to the social cost of carbon because this is the externality that the usage of these inputs generates. I consider a policymaker who cares about future generations and may discount the future less than the individuals in the economy. This paper's main theoretical result is that the uniform taxation rule does not carry over to an economy with a low social discount rate. In particular, the optimal carbon tax on oil does not equal the optimal carbon tax on coal. Moreover, while the optimal tax on coal equals the social cost of carbon, the optimal carbon tax on oil follows a more general formula.",,2111732891, 1729206,Scholarly Journals,,"Belfiori, Maria Elisa",," Belfiori, Maria Elisa", 10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.026, Journal Article,, October 2018,,0301-4215,, English, English, 292-299,October 2018,Energy Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,121,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2111732891?accountid=14505," Energy Policy, vol. 121, October 2018, pp. 292-99", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03014215] Publisher's URL, 292," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Exhaustible Resources , Externality , Oil , Resources , Tax , Taxation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Change+and+Intergenerational+Equity%3A+Revisiting+the+Uniform+Taxation+Principle+on+Carbon+Energy+Inputs&amp;title=Energy+Policy&amp;issn=03014215&amp;date=2018-10-01&amp;volume=121&amp;issue=&amp;spage=292&amp;au=Belfiori%2C+Maria+Elisa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1729206&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.enpol.2018.06.026,EconLit
Bridges beyond Renewable Energy: Decarbonizing the Global Electricity Sector under Uncertainty,"Mitigating global climate change requires decarbonizing the electricity sector, but the optimal strategy for doing so is not obvious. As power plants fueled by coal and petroleum are phased out, other generation technologies must fill the gap. While technically feasible, many low-carbon technologies are currently expensive--though costs may fall with experience. As an alternative, natural gas-fired power plants provide lower-carbon electricity--and cheaply if gas is abundant. The least-cost portfolio of generation technologies depends on several uncertain parameters. This paper presents a stylized model of the global electricity sector and evaluates several decarbonization strategies focused on three bridge technologies--natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear--over the period 2015-2050. With constraints on total demand for electricity and penetration of renewables, I find that the results are sensitive to the learning curve for CCS, the cost of natural gas, and the social cost of carbon. Depending on the true state of the world, decision-makers may find either natural gas power plants or CCS to be least-cost options for decarbonization portfolios. The expected value of information from resolving uncertainty is hundreds of billions of dollars, indicating high social benefits from investments into scientific research.",,2183637955, 1754671,Scholarly Journals,,"Wendling, Zachary A",," Wendling, Zachary A", 10.1016/j.erss.2018.09.020, Journal Article,, February 2019,,2214-6296,, English, English, 235-245,February 2019,Energy Research and Social Science," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,48,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2183637955?accountid=14505," Energy Research and Social Science, vol. 48, February 2019, pp. 235-45", [URL:https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-research-and-social-science/issues] Publisher's URL, 235," Electric Utilities (L94) , Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy (L98) , Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Selected Countries , Climate , Electricity , Electricity Sector , Energy , Gas , Natural Gas , Nuclear , Power Plant",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Bridges+beyond+Renewable+Energy%3A+Decarbonizing+the+Global+Electricity+Sector+under+Uncertainty&amp;title=Energy+Research+and+Social+Science&amp;issn=22146296&amp;date=2019-02-01&amp;volume=48&amp;issue=&amp;spage=235&amp;au=Wendling%2C+Zachary+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Research+and+Social+Science&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1754671&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.erss.2018.09.020,EconLit
Abrupt Positive Feedback and the Social Cost of Carbon,"Optimal climate policy should act in a precautionary fashion to deal with tipping points that occur at some future random moment. The optimal carbon tax should include an additional component on top of the conventional present discounted value of marginal global warming damages. This component increases with the sensitivity of the hazard to temperature or the stock of atmospheric carbon. If the hazard of a catastrophe is constant, no correction is needed of the usual Pigouvian tax. The results are applied to a tipping point resulting from an abrupt and irreversible release of greenhouse gases from the ocean floors and surface of the earth, which set in motion a positive feedback loop. Convex enough hazard functions cause overshooting of the carbon tax, but a linear hazard function gives rise to undershooting. A more convex hazard function and a high discount rate speed up adjustment.",,1520322827, 1429617,Scholarly Journals,,"van der Ploeg, Frederick",," van der Ploeg, Frederick", 10.1016/j.euroecorev.2014.01.004, Journal Article,, April 2014,,0014-2921,, English, English, 28-41,April 2014,European Economic Review," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,67,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1520322827?accountid=14505," European Economic Review, vol. 67, April 2014, pp. 28-41", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00142921] Publisher's URL, 28," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Economic Sociology, Economic Anthropology, Language, Social and Economic Stratification (Z13) , Climate , Pigouvian Tax , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Abrupt+Positive+Feedback+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=European+Economic+Review&amp;issn=00142921&amp;date=2014-04-01&amp;volume=67&amp;issue=&amp;spage=28&amp;au=van+der+Ploeg%2C+Frederick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Economic+Review&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1429617&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.euroecorev.2014.01.004,EconLit
The Trade-Off between Intra- and Intergenerational Equity in Climate Policy,"This paper focuses on two equity dimensions of climate policy, intra- and intergenerational, and analyzes the implications of equity preferences on climate policy, and on the production and consumption patterns in rich and poor countries. We develop a dynamic two-region model, in which each region suffers from global warming, but also has an inequality aversion over current consumption allocations. Inequality aversion generally lifts the consumption path of the poor region, while the rich region must take a greater share of the climate burden. Furthermore, with inequality aversion, the optimal climate policy generally leads to higher investment in clean capital in the North and in dirty capital in the South, thereby allowing the South to pollute more and develop faster. The optimal policy may even require the poor region to increase emissions relative to the uncoordinated Business-as-Usual case.

Optimal Climate Change Mitigation under Long-Term Growth Uncertainty: Stochastic Integrated Assessment and Analytic Findings,"Economic growth over the coming centuries is one of the major determinants of today's optimal greenhouse gas mitigation policy. At the same time, long-run economic growth is highly uncertain. This paper is the first to evaluate optimal mitigation policy under long-term growth uncertainty in a stochastic integrated assessment model of climate change. The sign and magnitude of the impact depend on preference characteristics and on how damages scale with production. We explain the different mechanisms driving optimal mitigation under certain growth, under uncertain technological progress in the discounted expected utility model, and under uncertain technological progress in a more comprehensive asset pricing model based on Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences. In the latter framework, the dominating uncertainty impact has the opposite sign of a deterministic growth impact; the sign switch results from an endogenous pessimism weighting. All of our numeric scenarios use a DICE based assessment model and find a higher optimal carbon tax than the deterministic DICE base case calibration.",,1558994170, 1450654,Scholarly Journals,,"Jensen, Svenn;Traeger, Christian P",," Jensen, Svenn", 10.1016/j.euroecorev.2014.01.008, Journal Article,, July 2014,,0014-2921,, English, English, 104-125,July 2014,European Economic Review," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,69,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1558994170?accountid=14505," European Economic Review, vol. 69, July 2014, pp. 104-25", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00142921] Publisher's URL, 104," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Technological Change: Choices and Consequences, Diffusion Processes (O33) , Environment and Growth (O44) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Technological Innovation (Q55) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Growth , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Climate+Change+Mitigation+under+Long-Term+Growth+Uncertainty%3A+Stochastic+Integrated+Assessment+and+Analytic+Findings&amp;title=European+Economic+Review&amp;issn=00142921&amp;date=2014-07-01&amp;volume=69&amp;issue=&amp;spage=104&amp;au=Jensen%2C+Svenn%3BTraeger%2C+Christian+P&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=European+Economic+Review&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1450654&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.euroecorev.2014.01.008,EconLit
"Carbon Pricing, Carbon Sequestration and Social Discounting","This paper studies the optimal taxation of carbon emissions in a dynastic economy. When the welfare function places direct Pareto weights on unborn generations, the social discount rate is lower than the discount rate of the current generation.

AYCTE operations exhibit a lack of revenue associated with each item served, since there is no per-item lost sales value incurred when demand exceeds supply; accordingly, the second objective of this research is to present a novel method for estimating shortfall costs in a setting with no marginal revenue per satisfied unit of demand. We examine empirical data from AYCTE operations at the University of Missouri's Campus Dining Services (CDS) to infer the per-item shortfall costs that are implied by CDS management's historical production decisions. Consistent with CDS management's stated aversion to shortfalls, we estimate shortfall values which are between 1.6 and 2.7 times larger than the procurement cost and between 30 and over 100 times larger than the disposal cost. Utilizing published estimates of life cycle CO2 and the social cost of carbon, we identify a per-portion environmental cost. We incorporate the environmental costs associated with wasted overproduction and the inferred shortfall cost estimates into a newsvendor model formulation, to identify new optimal production levels, illustrating this approach with application to a set of food items served by CDS. We find that optimal production levels are decreased significantly (18-25%) for food items with high environmental impacts (such as beef), and reduced less for foods with less embodied CO2.",,1863197576, 1613422,Scholarly Journals,,"Birisci, Esma;McGarvey, Ronald G",," Birisci, Esma", 10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.08.034, Journal Article,, December 2016,,0925-5273,, English, English, 157-164,December 2016,International Journal of Production Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,182,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1863197576?accountid=14505," International Journal of Production Economics, vol. 182, December 2016, pp. 157-64", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09255273] Publisher's URL, 157," Production, Cost, Capital, Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity, Capacity (D24) , Production, Pricing, and Market Structure, Size Distribution of Firms (L11) , Industrial Policy, Sectoral Planning Methods (L52) , Food, Beverages, Cosmetics, Tobacco, Wine and Spirits (L66) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , U.S. , Northern America , Beef , Cost , Environmental Impact , Food , Production",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Inferring+Shortfall+Costs+and+Integrating+Environmental+Costs+into+Optimal+Production+Levels+for+an+All-You-Care-to-Eat+Food+Service+Operation&amp;title=International+Journal+of+Production+Economics&amp;issn=09255273&amp;date=2016-12-01&amp;volume=182&amp;issue=&amp;spage=157&amp;au=Birisci%2C+Esma%3BMcGarvey%2C+Ronald+G&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Journal+of+Production+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1613422&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.ijpe.2016.08.034,EconLit
SCCs and the Use of IAMs: Let's Separate the Wheat from the Chaff,"This paper argues that integrated assessment models (IAMs) are useful tools to build corridors of social costs of carbon (SCC) reflecting divergent worldviews. Instead of pursuing the elusive quest for the right SCC, IAMs could indeed be useful tools to rationalize the different beliefs on climate related parameters (or worldviews) in the climate debate and help build politically coherent corridors of SCCs. We first take the example of the Stern-Nordhaus controversy as an illustration of the impossible quest for the right SCC. Disentangling the drivers of this controversy, we show that the main differences in results come from a mix of ethical choices of the representative agent (pure time preference), long-term assumptions on technical parameters (abatement cost dynamics) and climate related unknowns (climate sensitivity). We then argue that these sources of disagreement can be best understood as differing worldviews rather than pure scientific uncertainties. This implies that IAMs are of limited help in determining the right SCC, in line with Pindyck (2017). But contrary to him, we consider it necessary to separate the wheat from the chaff, and argue for a middle way between the blind confidence in IAMs' outputs and their full rejection with respect to the SCC debate. Instead, we show how they could help rationalize the climate debates around a corridor of SCCs. We thus analyze the drivers of such corridors of values, or how the sources of divergent worldviews differently impact the SCC-abatement space with time. All in all, the climate policy debate around carbon pricing can benefit from a renewed understanding of the role of IAMs, less divinatory and more institutionally centered.",,2108221488, 1728489,Scholarly Journals,,"Espagne, Etienne;Pottier, Antonin;Fabert, Baptiste Perrissin;Nadaud, Franck;Dumas, Patrice",," Espagne, Etienne", 10.1016/j.inteco.2018.02.004, Journal Article,, October 2018,,2110-7017,, English, English, 29-47,October 2018,International Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,155,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2108221488?accountid=14505," International Economics, vol. 155, October 2018, pp. 29-47", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/21107017] Publisher's URL, 29," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=SCCs+and+the+Use+of+IAMs%3A+Let%27s+Separate+the+Wheat+from+the+Chaff&amp;title=International+Economics&amp;issn=21107017&amp;date=2018-10-01&amp;volume=155&amp;issue=&amp;spage=29&amp;au=Espagne%2C+Etienne%3BPottier%2C+Antonin%3BFabert%2C+Baptiste+Perrissin%3BNadaud%2C+Franck%3BDumas%2C+Patrice&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1728489&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.inteco.2018.02.004,EconLit
Social Value of Mitigation Activities and Forms of Carbon Pricing,"In the Decision accompanying the Paris Agreement, the Conference of the Parties ""recognizes the social, economic and environmental value of voluntary mitigation actions and their co-benefits to adaptation, health and sustainable development."" This paper argues that this Social Value of Mitigation Activities (SVMA) can lay the ground to a new set of tools in climate policies, complementary to more traditional carbon pricing strategies. It first proposes a summary of the economic and political reasons which lead to this article 108 of the Paris Agreement, and the follow-up that emerged since December 2015. It then gives a theoretical back-up to this necessity of SVMA as a climate policy tool by deriving it from the more usual concepts of Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and Shadow Price of Carbon (SPC). The use of such a value to help fund projects at the micro-level is proposed in a specific institutional arrangement, especially when carbon pricing strategies fail to be implemented at the optimal level. Its potential to bridge the macro-level funding gap between developed and developing or emerging countries is also developed. The last section concludes on the perspectives opened by the recent Stern-Stiglitz report and its corridor of carbon prices to the local and global implementation of SVMAs.",,2108224613, 1728487,Scholarly Journals,,"Hourcade, Jean-Charles;Pottier, Antonin;Espagne, Etienne",," Hourcade, Jean-Charles", 10.1016/j.inteco.2018.06.001, Journal Article,, October 2018,,2110-7017,, English, English, 8-18,October 2018,International Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,155,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2108224613?accountid=14505," International Economics, vol. 155, October 2018, pp. 8-18", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/21107017] Publisher's URL, 8," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Social+Value+of+Mitigation+Activities+and+Forms+of+Carbon+Pricing&amp;title=International+Economics&amp;issn=21107017&amp;date=2018-10-01&amp;volume=155&amp;issue=&amp;spage=8&amp;au=Hourcade%2C+Jean-Charles%3BPottier%2C+Antonin%3BEspagne%2C+Etienne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=International+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1728487&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.inteco.2018.06.001,EconLit
Climate Tipping Points and Solar Geoengineering,"We study optimal climate policy in the presence of climate tipping points and solar geoengineering. Solar geoengineering reduces temperatures without reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate tipping points are irreversible and uncertain events that can alter the dynamics of the climate system. We analyze three different rules related to the availability of solar geoengineering, and we model three distinct types of tipping points. Before reaching the tipping point, the introduction of solar geoengineering reduces the amount of mitigation, lowers temperatures and increases carbon concentrations. The capacity of solar geoengineering to deal with climate damages depends on the type of tipping point. Solar geoengineering is most effective at dealing with tipping points that affect the responsiveness of temperature to carbon, and it is least effective at dealing with tipping points that cause direct economic losses.",,1872220811, 1618745,Scholarly Journals,,"Heutel, Garth;Moreno-Cruz, Juan;Shayegh, Soheil",," Heutel, Garth", 10.1016/j.jebo.2016.07.002, Journal Article,, December 2016,,0167-2681,, English, English, 19-45,December 2016,Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,132,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872220811?accountid=14505," Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, vol. 132, Part B December 2016, pp. 19-45", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01672681] Publisher's URL, 19," Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Gas",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Tipping+Points+and+Solar+Geoengineering&amp;title=Journal+of+Economic+Behavior+and+Organization&amp;issn=01672681&amp;date=2016-12-01&amp;volume=132&amp;issue=&amp;spage=19&amp;au=Heutel%2C+Garth%3BMoreno-Cruz%2C+Juan%3BShayegh%2C+Soheil&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Economic+Behavior+and+Organization&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1618745&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jebo.2016.07.002,EconLit
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming,"Despite growing empirical evidence of the link between environmental policy and innovation, most economic models of environmental policy treat technology as exogenous. For long-term problems such as climate change, this omission may be significant. In this paper, I modify the DICE model of climate change (Managing the Global Commons: the Economics of the Greenhouse Effect, MIT press, Cambridge, MA, 1994; Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming, MIT press, Cambridge, MA, 2000) to allow for induced innovation in the energy sector. Ignoring induced technological change overstates the welfare costs of an optimal carbon tax policy by 9.4%. However, cost savings, rather than increased environmental benefits, appear to drive the welfare gains, as the effect of induced innovation on emissions and mean global temperature is small. Sensitivity analysis shows that potential crowding out of other R&D and market failures in the R&D sector are the most important limiting factors to the potential of induced innovation. Differences in these key assumptions explain much of the variation in the findings of other similar models.",,56224783, 0738142,Scholarly Journals,,"Popp, David",," Popp, David", 10.1016/j.jeem.2003.09.002, Journal Article,, July 2004,,0095-0696,1, English, English, 742-768,July 2004,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2004,, American Economic Association,48,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56224783?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 48, no. 1, July 2004, pp. 742-68", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 742," Technological Change: Choices and Consequences, Diffusion Processes (O33) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate , Technological Change , Technology",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=ENTICE%3A+Endogenous+Technological+Change+in+the+DICE+Model+of+Global+Warming&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2004-07-01&amp;volume=48&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=742&amp;au=Popp%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0738142&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2003.09.002,EconLit
On International Equity Weights and National Decision Making on Climate Change,"Estimates of the marginal damage costs of carbon dioxide emissions require the aggregation of monetised impacts of climate change over people with different incomes and in different jurisdictions. Implicitly or explicitly, such estimates assume a social welfare function and hence a particular attitude towards equity and justice. We show that previous approaches to equity weighting are inappropriate from a national decision maker's point of view, because domestic impacts are not valued at domestic values. We propose four alternatives (sovereignty, altruism, good neighbour, and compensation) with different views on concern for and liability towards foreigners. The four alternatives imply radically different estimates of the social cost of carbon and hence the optimal intensity of climate policy.",,753926775, 1120009,Scholarly Journals,,"Anthoff, David;Tol, Richard S J",," Anthoff, David", 10.1016/j.jeem.2010.04.002, Journal Article,, July 2010,,0095-0696,1, English, English, 14-20,July 2010,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2010,, American Economic Association,60,https://search.proquest.com/docview/753926775?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 60, no. 1, July 2010, pp. 14-20", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 14," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Selected Countries , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=On+International+Equity+Weights+and+National+Decision+Making+on+Climate+Change&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2010-07-01&amp;volume=60&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=14&amp;au=Anthoff%2C+David%3BTol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1120009&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2010.04.002,EconLit
Strategic Climate Policy with Offsets and Incomplete Abatement: Carbon Taxes versus Cap-and-Trade,"This paper provides a first analysis of a ""policy bloc"" of fossil fuel importers which implements an optimal climate policy, faces a (non-policy) fringe of other fuel importers, and an exporter bloc, and purchases offset from the fringe. We compare a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade scheme for the policy bloc, in either case accompanied by an efficient offset mechanism for reducing emissions in the fringe. The policy bloc is shown to prefer a tax over a cap, since only a tax reduces the fuel export price and by more when the policy bloc is larger. Offsets are also more favorable to the policy bloc under a tax than under a cap. The optimal offset price under a carbon tax is below the tax rate, while under a cap and free quota trading the offset price must equal the quota price. The domestic carbon and offset prices are both higher under a tax than under a cap when the policy bloc is small. When the policy bloc is larger, the offset price can be higher under a cap. Fringe countries gain by mitigation in the policy bloc, more under a carbon tax since the fuel import price is lower.",,1462181701, 1403182,Scholarly Journals,,"Strand, Jon",," Strand, Jon", 10.1016/j.jeem.2013.03.002, Journal Article,, September 2013,,0095-0696,2, English, English, 202-218,September 2013,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,66,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1462181701?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 66, no. 2, September 2013, pp. 202-18", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 202," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Tax , Taxes",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Strategic+Climate+Policy+with+Offsets+and+Incomplete+Abatement%3A+Carbon+Taxes+versus+Cap-and-Trade&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=66&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=202&amp;au=Strand%2C+Jon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1403182&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2013.03.002,EconLit
Carbon Abatement in the Fuel Market with Biofuels: Implications for Second Best Policies,"A carbon tax on fuel would penalize carbon intensive fuels like gasoline and shift fuel consumption to less carbon intensive alternatives like biofuels. Since biofuel production competes for land with agricultural production, a carbon tax could increase land rents and raise food prices. This paper analyzes the welfare effect of a carbon tax on fuel consisting of gasoline and biofuel in the presence of a labor tax, with and without a biofuel subsidy. The market impacts of a carbon tax are also compared with that of a subsidy. Findings show that if a carbon tax increases biofuel demand, the tax interaction effect due to higher fuel prices is exacerbated by higher land rent and food prices and greater erosion of the carbon tax base. Thus, the second best optimal carbon tax for fuel is lower with biofuel in the fuel mix, especially if biofuel is subsidized.",,1520324278, 1430877,Scholarly Journals,,"Crago, Christine Lasco;Khanna, Madhu",," Crago, Christine Lasco", 10.1016/j.jeem.2013.11.001, Journal Article,, March 2014,,0095-0696,2, English, English, 89-103,March 2014,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,67,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1520324278?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 67, no. 2, March 2014, pp. 89-103", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 89," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Agricultural R&D, Agricultural Technology, Biofuels, Agricultural Extension Services (Q16) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Fuel , Subsidy , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Carbon+Abatement+in+the+Fuel+Market+with+Biofuels%3A+Implications+for+Second+Best+Policies&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2014-03-01&amp;volume=67&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=89&amp;au=Crago%2C+Christine+Lasco%3BKhanna%2C+Madhu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1430877&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2013.11.001,EconLit
"Declining Discount Rates and the Fisher Effect: Inflated Past, Discounted Future?","Uncertain and persistent real interest rates underpin one argument for using a declining term structure of social discount rates in the Expected Net Present Value (ENPV) framework. Despite being controversial, this approach has influenced both the Inter-Agency Working Group on Cost-Benefit Analysis and the UK government's guidelines on discounting. We first clarify the theoretical basis of the ENPV approach. Then, rather than following previous work which used a single series of U.S. Treasury bond returns, we treat nominal interest rates and inflation as co-integrated series and estimate the empirical term structure of discount rates via the 'Fisher Effect'. This nests previous empirical models and is more flexible. It also addresses an irregularity in previous work which used data on nominal interest rates until 1950, and real interest rates thereafter.

A Simple Formula for the Social Cost of Carbon,"The social cost of carbon (SCC) is the monetized damage from emitting one unit of CO[subscript 2] to the atmosphere, often obtained from computational Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). We develop a closed-form formula that approximates the SCC for a general economy, and then explore the capacity of the analytical approach to capture the key SCC drivers and thus to replicate the results of the deterministic IAMs. The formula explains the parameter-driven SCC variation of a mainstream IAM without a systematic bias. The sensitivity analysis identifies and measures the performance limits of the closed-form formulas. We then use the analytic formula to structurally interpret a distribution of SCCs from deterministic IAMs, and develop an analytical breakdown and quantification of how different sets of parameters contribute to the SCC distribution. This allows the user of the formula to evaluate where particular parameter choices tend to place the resulting SCC outcome in the distribution of outcomes for the universe of deterministic IAMs.",,1800696672, 1573445,Scholarly Journals,,"van den Bijgaart, Inge;Gerlagh, Reyer;Liski, Matti",," van den Bijgaart, Inge", 10.1016/j.jeem.2016.01.005, Journal Article,, May 2016,,0095-0696,, English, English, 75-94,May 2016,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,77,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1800696672?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 77, May 2016, pp. 75-94", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 75," Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Simple+Formula+for+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2016-05-01&amp;volume=77&amp;issue=&amp;spage=75&amp;au=van+den+Bijgaart%2C+Inge%3BGerlagh%2C+Reyer%3BLiski%2C+Matti&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1573445&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2016.01.005,EconLit
How Certain Are We about the Certainty-Equivalent Long Term Social Discount Rate?,"Theoretical arguments for using a term structure of social discount rates (SDR) that declines with the time horizon have influenced government guidelines in the US and Europe. The certainty equivalent discount rate that often underpins this guidance embodies uncertainty in the primitives of the SDR, such as growth. For distant time horizons the probability distributions of these primitives are ambiguous and the certainty equivalent itself is uncertain. Yet, if a limited set of characteristics of the unknown probability distributions can be agreed upon, 'sharp' upper and lower bounds can be defined for the certainty-equivalent SDR. Unfortunately, even with considerable agreement on these features, these bounds are widely spread for horizons beyond 75 years. So while estimates of the present value of intergenerational impacts, including the social cost of carbon, can be bounded in the presence of this ambiguity, they typically remain so imprecise as to provide little practical guidance.",,1834370896, 1596345,Scholarly Journals,,"Freeman, Mark C;Groom, Ben",," Freeman, Mark C", 10.1016/j.jeem.2016.06.004, Journal Article,, September 2016,,0095-0696,, English, English, 152-168,September 2016,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,79,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1834370896?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 79, September 2016, pp. 152-68", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 152," Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=How+Certain+Are+We+about+the+Certainty-Equivalent+Long+Term+Social+Discount+Rate%3F&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=79&amp;issue=&amp;spage=152&amp;au=Freeman%2C+Mark+C%3BGroom%2C+Ben&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1596345&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2016.06.004,EconLit
"When Starting with the Most Expensive Option Makes Sense: Optimal Timing, Cost and Sectoral Allocation of Abatement Investment","This paper finds that it is optimal to start a long-term emission-reduction strategy with significant short-term abatement investment, even if the optimal carbon price starts low and grows progressively over time. Moreover, optimal marginal abatement investment costs differ across sectors of the economy. It may be preferable to spend $25 to avoid the marginal ton of carbon in a sector where abatement capital is expensive, such as public transportation, or in a sector with large abatement potential, such as the power sector, than $15 for the marginal ton in a sector with lower cost or lower abatement potential. The reason, distinct from learning spillovers, is that reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires investment in long-lived abatement capital such as clean power plants or public transport infrastructure. The value of abatement investment comes from avoided emissions, but also from the value of abatement capital in the future. The optimal levelized cost of conserved carbon can thus be higher than the optimal carbon price. It is higher in sectors with higher investment needs: those where abatement capital is more expensive or sectors with larger abatement potential. We compare our approach to the traditional abatement-cost-curve model and discuss implications for policy design.",,2032390705, 1698793,Scholarly Journals,,"Vogt-Schilb, Adrien;Meunier, Guy;Hallegatte, Stephane",," Vogt-Schilb, Adrien", 10.1016/j.jeem.2017.12.001, Journal Article,, March 2018,,0095-0696,, English, English, 210-233,March 2018,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,88,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2032390705?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 88, March 2018, pp. 210-33", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 210," Intertemporal Firm Choice: Investment, Capacity, and Financing (D25) , Capital Budgeting, Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies, Capacity (G31) , Electric Utilities (L94) , Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy (L98) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion, Travel Time, Safety and Accidents, Transportation Noise (R41) , Gas , Investment , Power Plant , Transport , Transportation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=When+Starting+with+the+Most+Expensive+Option+Makes+Sense%3A+Optimal+Timing%2C+Cost+and+Sectoral+Allocation+of+Abatement+Investment&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2018-03-01&amp;volume=88&amp;issue=&amp;spage=210&amp;au=Vogt-Schilb%2C+Adrien%3BMeunier%2C+Guy%3BHallegatte%2C+Stephane&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1698793&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2017.12.001,EconLit
Instrument Choice and Stranded Assets in the Transition to Clean Capital,"This paper compares the impact of different climate mitigation policies--mandates, feebates, performance standards, and carbon pricing--in a Ramsey model with clean and polluting capital, irreversible investment, and a climate constraint. These policy instruments imply different transitions to the same balanced growth path. The optimal carbon price minimizes the discounted social cost of the transition to clean capital, but may prompt premature retirement of existing polluting capacities and significant private costs in the form of stranded assets. Second-best mandates and feebates affect new investment decisions without providing incentives to under-use existing polluting equipment. These instruments lead to higher discounted social costs, but smoother abatement costs, and do not result in premature retirement or stranded assets. A phased-in carbon price can avoid premature retirement but still result in stranded assets, that is in a drop of wealth for the owners of polluting capital. We discuss a potential trade-off between the political feasibility and cost-effectiveness of climate mitigation policies.",,2388296919, 1827543,Scholarly Journals," World Bank , Inter-American Development Bank , World Bank","Rozenberg, Julie;Vogt-Schilb, Adrien;Hallegatte, Stephane",," Rozenberg, Julie", 10.1016/j.jeem.2018.10.005, Journal Article,, March 2020,,0095-0696,, English, English,,March 2020,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, CSAPTjournals,2020,, American Economic Association,100,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2388296919?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 100", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL,," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Polluting",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Instrument+Choice+and+Stranded+Assets+in+the+Transition+to+Clean+Capital&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2020-03-01&amp;volume=100&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rozenberg%2C+Julie%3BVogt-Schilb%2C+Adrien%3BHallegatte%2C+Stephane&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1827543&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2018.10.005,EconLit
The Social Cost of Carbon Revisited,"An estimate of the social cost of carbon (SCC) is crucial to climate policy. But how should we estimate the SCC? A common approach uses an integrated assessment model (IAM) to simulate time paths for the atmospheric CO2 concentration, its impact on temperature, and resulting reductions in GDP. I have argued that IAMs have deficiencies that make them poorly suited for this job, but what is the alternative? I present an approach to estimating an average SCC, which I argue can be a useful guide for policy. I rely on a survey of experts to elicit opinions regarding (1) probabilities of alternative economic outcomes of climate change, but not the causes of those outcomes; and (2) the reduction in emissions required to avert an extreme outcome, i.e., a large climate-induced reduction in GDP. The average SCC is the ratio of the present value of lost GDP from an extreme outcome to the total emission reduction needed to avert that outcome. I discuss the survey instrument, explain how experts were identified, and present results. I obtain SCC estimates of $200/mt or higher, but the variation across experts is large. Trimming outliers and focusing on experts who expressed a high degree of confidence in their answers yields lower SCCs, $80 to $100/mt, but still well above the IAM-based estimates used by the U.S. government.",,2209994710, 1763578,Scholarly Journals,,"Pindyck, Robert S",," Pindyck, Robert S", 10.1016/j.jeem.2019.02.003, Journal Article,, March 2019,,0095-0696,, English, English, 140-160,March 2019,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,94,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2209994710?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 94, March 2019, pp. 140-60", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 140," Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+Revisited&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2019-03-01&amp;volume=94&amp;issue=&amp;spage=140&amp;au=Pindyck%2C+Robert+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1763578&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2019.02.003,EconLit
Cumulative Carbon Emissions and Economic Policy: In Search of General Principles,"We exploit recent advances in climate science to develop a physically consistent, yet surprisingly simple, model of climate policy. It seems that key economic models have greatly overestimated the delay between carbon emissions and warming, and ignored the saturation of carbon sinks that takes place when the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide rises. This has important implications for climate policy. If carbon emissions are abated, damages are avoided almost immediately. Therefore it is optimal to reduce emissions significantly in the near term and bring about a slow transition to optimal peak warming, even if optimal steady-state/peak warming is high. The optimal carbon price should start relatively high and grow relatively fast.",,2273740634, 1781452,Scholarly Journals,,"Dietz, Simon;Venmans, Frank",," Dietz, Simon", 10.1016/j.jeem.2019.04.003, Journal Article,, July 2019,,0095-0696,, English, English, 108-129,July 2019,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,96,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2273740634?accountid=14505," Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 96, July 2019, pp. 108-29", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00950696] Publisher's URL, 108," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Cumulative+Carbon+Emissions+and+Economic+Policy%3A+In+Search+of+General+Principles&amp;title=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;issn=00950696&amp;date=2019-07-01&amp;volume=96&amp;issue=&amp;spage=108&amp;au=Dietz%2C+Simon%3BVenmans%2C+Frank&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1781452&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jeem.2019.04.003,EconLit
Optimal Climate Policies in a Dynamic Multi-country Equilibrium Model,"This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model with an arbitrary number of different regions to study the economic consequences of climate change under alternative climate policies. Regions differ with respect to their state of economic development, factor endowments, and climate damages and trade on global markets for capital, output, and exhaustible resources. Our main result derives an optimal climate policy consisting of an emissions tax and a transfer policy. The optimal tax can be determined explicitly in our framework and is independent of any weights attached to the interests of different countries. Such weights only determine optimal transfers which distribute tax revenues across countries. We infer that the real political issue is not the tax policy required to reduce global warming but rather how the burden of climate change should be shared via transfer payments between different countries. We propose a simple transfer policy which induces a Pareto improvement relative to the Laissez faire solution. A calibrated example quantifies Pareto-improving transfers between rich and poor countries.",,2171654740, 1750635,Scholarly Journals,,"Hillebrand, Elmar;Hillebrand, Marten",," Hillebrand, Elmar", 10.1016/j.jet.2018.11.001, Journal Article,, January 2019,,0022-0531,, English, English, 200-239,January 2019,Journal of Economic Theory," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,179,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2171654740?accountid=14505," Journal of Economic Theory, vol. 179, January 2019, pp. 200-239", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00220531] Publisher's URL, 200," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Revenue , Tax , Transfer Payment",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Climate+Policies+in+a+Dynamic+Multi-country+Equilibrium+Model&amp;title=Journal+of+Economic+Theory&amp;issn=00220531&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=179&amp;issue=&amp;spage=200&amp;au=Hillebrand%2C+Elmar%3BHillebrand%2C+Marten&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Economic+Theory&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1750635&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jet.2018.11.001,EconLit
Faustmann and the Climate,"The paper presents an adjusted Faustmann Rule for optimal harvest of a forest when there is a social cost of carbon emissions. The theoretical framework takes account of the dynamics and interactions of forests' multiple carbon pools and assumes an infinite time horizon. Our paper provides a theoretical foundation for numerical model studies that have found that a social cost of carbon implies longer optimal rotation periods and that if the social cost of carbon exceeds a certain threshold value the forest should not be harvested. At the same time we show that it could be a net social benefit from harvesting even if the commercial profit from harvest is negative. If that is the case, the optimal harvest age is decreasing in the social cost of carbon.",,1550987477, 1447883,Scholarly Journals,,"Hoel, Michael;Holtsmark, Bjart;Holtsmark, Katinka",," Hoel, Michael", 10.1016/j.jfe.2014.04.003, Journal Article,, April 2014,,1104-6899,2, English, English, 192-210,April 2014,Journal of Forest Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,20,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1550987477?accountid=14505," Journal of Forest Economics, vol. 20, no. 2, April 2014, pp. 192-210", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/11046899] Publisher's URL, 192," Renewable Resources and Conservation: Forestry (Q23) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate , Forest",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Faustmann+and+the+Climate&amp;title=Journal+of+Forest+Economics&amp;issn=11046899&amp;date=2014-04-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=192&amp;au=Hoel%2C+Michael%3BHoltsmark%2C+Bjart%3BHoltsmark%2C+Katinka&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Forest+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1447883&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jfe.2014.04.003,EconLit
Be Careful What You Calibrate For: Social Discounting in General Equilibrium,"Concerns about intergenerational equity have led to an influential practice of setting social utility discount rates based on ethical considerations rather than to match household behavior, particularly in climate change economics (e.g., Stern, 2006). This paper formalizes the broader policy implications of this approach in general equilibrium by characterizing jointly optimal environmental and fiscal policies in a climate-economy model with differential planner-household discounting. First, I show that decentralizing the optimal allocation requires not only high carbon prices but also fundamental changes to tax policy: If the government discounts the future less than households, implementing the optimal allocation requires an effective capital income subsidy (a negative intertemporal wedge), and, in a setting with distortionary taxation, an effective labor-consumption tax wedge that is decreasing over time. Second, if the government cannot subsidize capital income, the constrained-optimal carbon tax may be up to 50% below the present value of marginal damages (the social cost of carbon) due to the general equilibrium effects of climate policy on household savings. Third, given the choice to optimize either carbon, capital, or labor income taxes, the socially discounting planner's welfare ranking is ambiguous over a standard range of parameters.

The Design of Optimal Climate Policy with Air Pollution Co-benefits,"This paper develops a model of an optimal regulatory program for greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions that accommodates the benefits due to reductions of co-pollutants including: sulfur dioxide (SO""2), nitrogen oxides (NO""x), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and fine particulate matter (PM""2"".""5). Employing per ton damage estimates for the co-pollutants produced by an integrated assessment model, co-pollutant damage estimates per ton carbon dioxide equivalent (CO""2e) are developed for over 10,000 sources of GHGs in the lower 48 states including both transportation sources and electric power generation. For coal-fired electric power generation, the co-pollutant damages are larger in magnitude than recent peer-reviewed estimates of the marginal damage for GHGs. The co-pollutant damage per ton CO""2e varies considerably across source types and source location. The paper estimates the welfare gain from adopting a policy that encompasses the spatially variant co-pollutant damage to be between $1 million and $85 million annually. The range depends on the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve. The paper also shows that a distortionary aggregate emission cap reduces the advantage of differentiated policy. Provided an excessively strict cap, the spatially differentiated policy may reduce aggregate welfare. This result has important implications for GHG policy in the United States; although co-pollutant benefits of abating GHGs have been shown to be significant in magnitude, tailoring climate policy to reflect these source-specific co-benefits is not necessarily socially beneficial. This bolsters arguments for upstream policy designs.",,1125212386, 1328568,Scholarly Journals,,"Muller, Nicholas Z",," Muller, Nicholas Z", 10.1016/j.reseneeco.2012.07.002, Journal Article,, November 2012,,0928-7655,4, English, English, 696-722,November 2012,Resource and Energy Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2012,, American Economic Association,34,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1125212386?accountid=14505," Resource and Energy Economics, vol. 34, no. 4, November 2012, pp. 696-722", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09287655] Publisher's URL, 696," Electric Utilities (L94) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Air Pollution , Climate , Pollutant , Pollution",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Design+of+Optimal+Climate+Policy+with+Air+Pollution+Co-benefits&amp;title=Resource+and+Energy+Economics&amp;issn=09287655&amp;date=2012-11-01&amp;volume=34&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=696&amp;au=Muller%2C+Nicholas+Z&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Resource+and+Energy+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1328568&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.reseneeco.2012.07.002,EconLit
Optimal Monitoring and Offset Prices in Voluntary Emissions Markets,"Carbon offset markets are modeled as an uninformed regulator who wishes to use a voluntary price instrument to reduce harmful emissions under varying degrees of private information. Regulators offer agricultural producers payments to reduce their emissions for some price per ton relative to the social price of carbon. Abstracting from distributional concerns or costly transfers, we derive optimal contracts for offsets contracts, minimizing welfare losses from adverse selection. The model shows how the level of monitoring and the prices offered should vary depending on the regulator's information. Although existing and proposed policies discount the price that offset producers receive relative to the social cost of carbon to account for the adverse selection, our model argues that optimal offset prices may be above the social cost of carbon for sufficiently high levels of monitoring. Our model also identifies and quantifies the types of firms that produce additional offsets for a given contract, offering guidance on how regulators might better target offset contracts.",,1708505255, 1514266,Scholarly Journals,,"Bento, Antonio;Ho, Benjamin;Ramirez-Basora, Mario",," Bento, Antonio", 10.1016/j.reseneeco.2015.05.002, Journal Article,, August 2015,,0928-7655,, English, English, 202-223,August 2015,Resource and Energy Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,41,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1708505255?accountid=14505," Resource and Energy Economics, vol. 41, August 2015, pp. 202-23", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/09287655] Publisher's URL, 202," Asymmetric and Private Information, Mechanism Design (D82) , Economics of Contract: Theory (D86) , Agriculture: Aggregate Supply and Demand Analysis, Prices (Q11) , Land Ownership and Tenure, Land Reform, Land Use, Irrigation, Agriculture and Environment (Q15) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Economic Sociology, Economic Anthropology, Language, Social and Economic Stratification (Z13) , Adverse Selection , Contracts , Information , Monitoring , Optimal Contracts , Prices",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Monitoring+and+Offset+Prices+in+Voluntary+Emissions+Markets&amp;title=Resource+and+Energy+Economics&amp;issn=09287655&amp;date=2015-08-01&amp;volume=41&amp;issue=&amp;spage=202&amp;au=Bento%2C+Antonio%3BHo%2C+Benjamin%3BRamirez-Basora%2C+Mario&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Resource+and+Energy+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1514266&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.reseneeco.2015.05.002,EconLit
The Impacts of Telecommuting in Dublin,"Telecommuting has been perceived as an effective means of reducing commuter related trips, travel time and emissions. Previously, the lack of access to broadband Internet connection and teleconferencing software from home has acted as a barrier to telecommuting regularly or at all. However, with advances in information and communication technology in recent years telecommuting is becoming a viable option for employers and employees to undertake. This paper examines the current trends of full day and part day telecommuting in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), and attempts to ascertain the most influential drivers and constraints related to telecommuting. The research presented estimates of the environmental benefits from individuals that telecommute. Finally, this paper seeks to determine the magnitude of carbon emissions savings from individuals adopting telecommuting and provides a social cost of carbon saving value. The survey results presented suggest that approximately 44% of the population of the GDA telecommute at least once a month. The findings also indicate that needing contact with colleagues is the most influential constraint to telecommuting, while greater flexibility and avoiding travelling in peak periods are the most important drivers in the propensity to telecommute. Finally, this study shows that there are substantial carbon reductions and social cost of carbon savings. Thus illustrating how telecommuting can be a viable and sustainable policy in the GDA or in other similar sized regions.",,1883164253, 1625251,Scholarly Journals,,"O'Keefe, Paul;Caulfield, Brian;Brazil, William;White, Peter",," O'Keefe, Paul", 10.1016/j.retrec.2016.06.010, Journal Article,, September 2016,,0739-8859,, English, English, 13-20,September 2016,Research in Transportation Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,57,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883164253?accountid=14505," Research in Transportation Economics, vol. 57, September 2016, pp. 13-20", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/07398859] Publisher's URL, 13," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration, Regional Labor Markets, Population, Neighborhood Characteristics (R23) , Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion, Travel Time, Safety and Accidents, Transportation Noise (R41) , Ireland , Europe , Population",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Impacts+of+Telecommuting+in+Dublin&amp;title=Research+in+Transportation+Economics&amp;issn=07398859&amp;date=2016-09-01&amp;volume=57&amp;issue=&amp;spage=13&amp;au=O%27Keefe%2C+Paul%3BCaulfield%2C+Brian%3BBrazil%2C+William%3BWhite%2C+Peter&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Research+in+Transportation+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1625251&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.retrec.2016.06.010,EconLit
How to Road Price in a World with Electric Vehicles and Government Budget Constraints,"In this paper we examine what characterizes second-best road prices targeting external costs from driving electric (EV) and conventional (ICEV) vehicles when there are distortionary labor taxes and binding government budget constraints. Further, we examine how this second-best pricing fits with government set goals of reducing CO2 emissions. The paper further develops an analytical framework for assessing first- and second-best road prices on vehicle kilometers, extending it to include EVs and externalities that vary geographically and by time of day. We find that optimal road prices largely vary with external cost, but are also significantly affected by the interactions with the rest of the fiscal system. Not surprisingly, the highest road prices should be for ICEVs in large cities during peak hours due to high external costs. More surprisingly, we find that the road price for ICEVs in rural areas should be lower than that for EVs due to large fiscal interaction effects. These road prices give large welfare gains, but they lead to no reduction in carbon emissions when applying the currently recommended social cost of carbon.",,2166695833, 1749484,Scholarly Journals,,"Wangsness, Paal Brevik",," Wangsness, Paal Brevik", 10.1016/j.trd.2018.10.002, Journal Article,, December 2018,,1361-9209,, English, English, 635-657,December 2018,Transportation Research: Part D: Transport and Environment," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,65,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2166695833?accountid=14505," Transportation Research: Part D: Transport and Environment, vol. 65, December 2018, pp. 635-57", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/13619209] Publisher's URL, 635," Externalities (D62) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Transportation Economics: Government Pricing and Policy (R48) , Externalities , Roads , Vehicles , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=How+to+Road+Price+in+a+World+with+Electric+Vehicles+and+Government+Budget+Constraints&amp;title=Transportation+Research%3A+Part+D%3A+Transport+and+Environment&amp;issn=13619209&amp;date=2018-12-01&amp;volume=65&amp;issue=&amp;spage=635&amp;au=Wangsness%2C+Paal+Brevik&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Transportation+Research%3A+Part+D%3A+Transport+and+Environment&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1749484&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.trd.2018.10.002,EconLit
Returns to Rural Electrification: Evidence from Bhutan,"Rural electrification (RE) is a core component of the Sustainable Development Goals and a major focal point of the global development community. Despite this focus, more than one billion people worldwide lack access to electricity, and electrification rates need to more than quadruple to meet international goals. We believe that lack of progress is partly driven by a know-do gap, a misalignment between academic research and the information needs of policy makers. Most studies measuring the impacts of electrification focus on precise estimation of a few outcomes, specifically health, education and productivity impacts. Other important impacts, e.g. environmental, have remained largely unstudied. As a consequence, quantifying the full set of costs and benefits of expanding electricity access is difficult and rarely done. When cost benefit analyses are done, they are often incomplete, and conclusions are highly susceptible to unavailable or uncertain parameters. We illustrate these arguments in the case of Bhutan, where RE rates have expanded rapidly in the past few decades. We show that RE via grid extension had positive impacts related to fuelwood consumption, education, and employment, but we do not find an effect on health. We then use these impact estimates to conduct cost-benefit analyses. For the cost-benefit parameters not available from our impact evaluation, we transfer reasonable estimates from related contexts. To acknowledge the uncertainty induced by this process, we conduct Monte Carlo analyses and confirm that, while the private NPV calculations are robust to alternative parameter values, the social returns are sensitive to estimates of the social cost of carbon and costs of grid operation and maintenance. Based on this exercise, we highlight research gaps that persist and that preclude 1) careful cost-benefit analysis of RE more generally and 2) financial investment in the sector.",,2255445114, 1775266,Scholarly Journals,,"Litzow, Erin L;Pattanayak, Subhrendu K;Thinley, Tshering",," Litzow, Erin L", 10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.04.002, Journal Article,, September 2019,,0305-750X,, English, English, 75-96,September 2019,World Development," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,121,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2255445114?accountid=14505," World Development, vol. 121, September 2019, pp. 75-96", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/0305750X] Publisher's URL, 75," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Electric Utilities (L94) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis, Housing, Infrastructure (O18) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Regional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes (R11) , Bhutan , Asia , Cost Benefit , Development , Electricity , Rural",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Returns+to+Rural+Electrification%3A+Evidence+from+Bhutan&amp;title=World+Development&amp;issn=0305750X&amp;date=2019-09-01&amp;volume=121&amp;issue=&amp;spage=75&amp;au=Litzow%2C+Erin+L%3BPattanayak%2C+Subhrendu+K%3BThinley%2C+Tshering&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=World+Development&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1775266&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.worlddev.2019.04.002,EconLit

Ramsey Discounting Calls for Subtracting Climate Damages from Economic Growth Rates,"The Ramsey equation ties the utility discount rate and the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption together with per capita consumption growth rates to calculate consumption discount rates. For many applications, per capita consumption growth rates can be approximated with per capita output growth rates. That approximation does not work for climate change, which drives an ever-increasing and increasingly uncertain wedge between output and consumption growth. NAS (2017), in a central recommendation and illustrative example, conflates the two. The correct, consumption-based discounting method generally decreases consumption discount rates and, thus, increases the resulting Social Cost of Carbon Dioxide (SC-CO2).",,2127943054, 1737339,Scholarly Journals,,"Paul Kelleher, J;Wagner, Gernot",," Paul Kelleher, J", 10.1080/13504851.2018.1438581, Journal Article, 1466-4291, January 2019,,1350-4851,1, English, English, 79-82,January 2019,Applied Economics Letters," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,26,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2127943054?accountid=14505," Applied Economics Letters, vol. 26, no. 1, January 2019, pp. 79-82", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rael20] Publisher's URL, 79," Macroeconomics: Consumption, Saving, Wealth (E21) , Macroeconomics: Production (E23) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate , Consumption , Output",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Ramsey+Discounting+Calls+for+Subtracting+Climate+Damages+from+Economic+Growth+Rates&amp;title=Applied+Economics+Letters&amp;issn=13504851&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=79&amp;au=Paul+Kelleher%2C+J%3BWagner%2C+Gernot&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Applied+Economics+Letters&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1737339&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F13504851.2018.1438581,EconLit
Using the Social Cost of Carbon to Value Earth Observing Systems,"The goal of this study is to show how to quantify the benefits of accelerated learning about key parameters of the climatic system and use this knowledge to improve decision-making on climate policy. The US social cost of carbon (SCC) methodology is used in innovative ways to value new Earth observing systems (EOSs). The study departs from the strict US SCC methodology, and from previous work, in that net benefits are used instead of only damages to calculate the value of information of the enhanced systems. In other respects the US SCC methodology is followed closely. We compute the surfeit expected net benefits of learning the actionable information earlier, with the enhanced system, versus learning later with existing systems. The enhanced systems are designed to give reliable information about climate sensitivity on accelerated timescales relative to existing systems; therefore, the decision context stipulates that a global reduced emissions path would be deployed upon receiving suitable information on the rate of temperature rise with a suitable level of confidence. By placing the enhanced observing system in a decision context, the SCC enables valuing this system as a real option.",,2019800649, 1691245,Scholarly Journals,,"Cooke, Roger;Golub, Alexander;Wielicki, Bruce A;Young, David F;Mlynczak, Martin G;Baize, Rosemary R",," Cooke, Roger", 10.1080/14693062.2015.1110109, Journal Article, 1752-7457, April 2017,,1469-3062,3, English, English, 330-345,April 2017,Climate Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,17,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2019800649?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 17, no. 3, April 2017, pp. 330-45", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, 330," Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Using+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+to+Value+Earth+Observing+Systems&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2017-04-01&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=330&amp;au=Cooke%2C+Roger%3BGolub%2C+Alexander%3BWielicki%2C+Bruce+A%3BYoung%2C+David+F%3BMlynczak%2C+Martin+G%3BBaize%2C+Rosemary+R&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1691245&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F14693062.2015.1110109,EconLit
Optimal International Technology Cooperation for the Low-Carbon Transformation,"Research on low-carbon transformation pathways has focused on carbon pricing as a means for climate stabilization. By contrast, technology policies remain the more prominent national climate policy instruments today: renewable energy subsidies amount to more than US$100 billion per year globally--more than twice the value of priced carbon in 2016. Given technology spillovers and global learning effects, it remains unclear how technology policies can be coordinated internationally as part of climate stabilization policy. Our study is the first to derive optimal technology and climate policy for the 2C target using an energy-economy-climate model. We show an economic rationale to include an international technology protocol alongside carbon pricing: Cumulative low-carbon subsidies of more than US$1 trillion from 2020 until the end of the century mainly support solar power as well as electric- and hydrogen-powered passenger vehicles. Higher carbon pricing could replace subsidies at very low cost, but mitigation cost increases from delayed carbon pricing can be reduced only somewhat by stepping up subsidies. Our study suggests that existing low-carbon subsidies must be complemented by full carbon pricing to achieve 2C cost-efficiently: Alongside the optimal carbon price, low-carbon subsidies should amount to no more than similar to 6% of the value of priced carbon.

Zero Carbon Energy System Pathways for Ireland Consistent with the Paris Agreement,"The Paris Agreement is the last hope to keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees C. The consensus agrees to holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5 degrees C. Each Party's successive nationally determined contribution (NDC) will represent a progression beyond the party's then current NDC, and reflect its highest possible ambition. Using Ireland as a test case, we show that increased mitigation ambition is required to meet the Paris Agreement goals in contrast to current EU policy goals of an 80-95% reduction by 2050. For the 1.5 degrees C consistent carbon budgets, the technically feasible scenarios' abatement costs rise to greater than E8,100/tCO2 by 2050. The greatest economic impact is in the short term. Annual GDP growth rates in the period to 2020 reduce from 4% to 2.2% in the 1.5 degrees C scenario. While aiming for net zero emissions beyond 2050, investment decisions in the next 5-10 years are critical to prevent carbon lock-in. Key policy insights Economic growth can be maintained in Ireland while rapidly decarbonizing the energy system. The social cost of carbon needs to be included as standard in valuation of infrastructure investment planning, both by government finance departments and private investors. Technological feasibility is not the limiting factor in achieving rapid deep decarbonization. Immediate increased decarbonization ambition over the next 3-5 years is critical to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, acknowledging the current 80-95% reduction target is not consistent with temperature goals of 'well below' 2 degrees C and pursuing 1.5 degrees C. Applying carbon budgets to the energy system results in non-linear CO2 emissions reductions over time, which contrast with current EU policy targets, and the implied optimal climate policy and mitigation investment strategy.",,2157645458, 1742984,Scholarly Journals,,"Glynn, James;Gargiulo, Maurizio;Chiodi, Alessandro;Deane, Paul;Rogan, Fionn;O Gallachoir, Brian",," Glynn, James", 10.1080/14693062.2018.1464893, Journal Article, 1752-7457, January 2019,,1469-3062,1, English, English, 30-42,January 2019,Climate Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2019,, American Economic Association,19,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2157645458?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 19, no. 1, January 2019, pp. 30-42", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, 30," Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Ireland , Europe , Climate , Energy",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Zero+Carbon+Energy+System+Pathways+for+Ireland+Consistent+with+the+Paris+Agreement&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=30&amp;au=Glynn%2C+James%3BGargiulo%2C+Maurizio%3BChiodi%2C+Alessandro%3BDeane%2C+Paul%3BRogan%2C+Fionn%3BO+Gallachoir%2C+Brian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1742984&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F14693062.2018.1464893,EconLit
Curbing the Car: The Mitigation Potential of a Higher Carbon Price in the New Zealand Transport Sector,"Carbon dioxide emissions from New Zealand's transport sector have experienced rapid growth since 1990. In this paper, we investigate the scope for a targeted price signal to curb emissions growth and help deliver on the country's Paris Agreement pledges. Cost burdens on various income groups are investigated, and experts' opinions are elicited to evaluate two types of carbon price policies (i.e. a carbon tax and an increase in the current ETS price). We use two methodological approaches in this paper. Estimates of the social cost of carbon and the price elasticity of fuel demand are used to understand the mitigation potential of a higher carbon price, while a multi-criteria analysis technique is used to understand experts' preferences between an ETS and a carbon tax. The findings are that with a price elasticity of transport fuel demand of around -0.7, a carbon price between NZD 100 (USD 65) per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO2) and NZD 235 (USD 153)/tCO2 could reduce transport emissions by between 33% and 44% in 2030, respectively, from the 2016 level. The (uncompensated) cost-burdens on lower income households due to a hypothetical price of NZD 100/tCO2 and NZD 235/tCO2 are estimated to be around NZD 531 (USD 345)/year and NZD 670 (USD 436)/year per household respectively. Experts marginally favoured a carbon tax over an ETS because the revenue collected through a carbon tax could be utilized in a more holistic way to offset the tax burden on lower income households and fund emissions reduction technologies and infrastructures.",,2415792403, 1838478,Scholarly Journals," Victoria University of Wellington , Victoria University of Wellington , Victoria University of Wellington , Victoria University of Wellington","Hasan, Md Arif;Frame, David J;Chapman, Ralph;Archie, Kelli M",," Hasan, Md Arif", 10.1080/14693062.2020.1750334, Journal Article, 1752-7457, May 2020,,1469-3062,5, English, English, 563-576,May 2020,Climate Policy, CSAPTjournals,2020,, American Economic Association,20,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2415792403?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 20, no. 5, pp. 563-576", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, 563," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Railroads and Other Surface Transportation (L92) , Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy (L98) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion, Travel Time, Safety and Accidents, Transportation Noise (R41) , New Zealand , Oceania , Revenue , Tax , Transport",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Curbing+the+Car%3A+The+Mitigation+Potential+of+a+Higher+Carbon+Price+in+the+New+Zealand+Transport+Sector&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2020-05-01&amp;volume=20&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=563&amp;au=Hasan%2C+Md+Arif%3BFrame%2C+David+J%3BChapman%2C+Ralph%3BArchie%2C+Kelli+M&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1838478&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F14693062.2020.1750334,EconLit
Deforestation in the Amazon: A Unified Framework for Estimation and Policy Analysis,"Deforestation is a matter of pressing global concern, yet surprisingly little is known about the relative efficacy of various policies designed to combat it. This article sets out a framework for measuring the cost effectiveness of alternative policies--both command-and-control and incentive-based--in the Brazilian Amazon. First, I estimate the demand for deforestation on private properties, exploiting regional variation in transportation costs as a means to recover farmers' responses to permanent policies. Here, rescaling transportation costs using local yields allows me to express changes in farmers' valuations in dollars per hectare. I then use the estimated demand to infer farmers' willingness to deforest under different counterfactual policies, such as payments to avoid deforestation and taxes on land use, along with the corresponding potential farmers' lost surpluses. The results indicate that payment programmes and land use taxes on agricultural land can be highly effective in preserving the rainforest and also be substantially less expensive than command-and-control policies (approximately 8 times less costly). A carbon tax equal to the social cost of carbon could virtually eliminate all agricultural land in the Amazon, given the low agricultural returns there.",,2323086094, 1803974,Scholarly Journals, U of Toronto,"Souza-Rodrigues, Eduardo",," Souza-Rodrigues, Eduardo", 10.1093/restud/rdy070, Journal Article, 1467-937X, November 2019,,0034-6527,6, English, English, 2713-2744,November 2019,Review of Economic Studies, CSAPTjournals,2019,, American Economic Association,86,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2323086094?accountid=14505," Review of Economic Studies, vol. 86, no. 6, pp. 2713-2744", [URL:https://academic.oup.com/restud/issue] Publisher's URL, 2713," Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Land Ownership and Tenure, Land Reform, Land Use, Irrigation, Agriculture and Environment (Q15) , Agricultural Policy, Food Policy (Q18) , Renewable Resources and Conservation: Forestry (Q23) , Renewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q28) , Regional Government Analysis: Land Use and Other Regulations (R52) , Brazil , Latin America and the Caribbean , Agricultural Land , Deforestation , Farmers , Land Use , Policy , Rainforest , Regional",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Deforestation+in+the+Amazon%3A+A+Unified+Framework+for+Estimation+and+Policy+Analysis&amp;title=Review+of+Economic+Studies&amp;issn=00346527&amp;date=2019-11-01&amp;volume=86&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=2713&amp;au=Souza-Rodrigues%2C+Eduardo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Review+of+Economic+Studies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1803974&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1093%2Frestud%2Frdy070,EconLit
Fat Tails and the Social Cost of Carbon,"At high enough greenhouse gas concentrations, climate change might conceivably cause catastrophic damages with small but non-negligible probabilities. If the bad tail of climate damages is sufficiently fat, and if the coefficient of relative risk aversion is greater than one, the catastrophe-reducing insurance aspect of mitigation investments could in theory have a strong influence on raising the social cost of carbon. In this paper I exposit the influence of fat tails on climate change economics in a simple stark formulation focused on the social cost of carbon.

On Not Revisiting Official Discount Rates: Institutional Inertia and the Social Cost of Carbon,"Within the federal government, official decisions are a product of both substantive judgments and institutional constraints. With respect to discounting, current practice is governed by OMB Circular A-4 and the 2010 and 2013 technical support documents of the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon. Reconsideration of existing judgments must be subjected to a demanding process of internal review (and potentially to external review as well). Institutional constraints, including the need to obtain consensus, can impose obstacles to efforts to rethink existing practices, especially in an area like discounting, which is at once technical and highly controversial.

Climate Change Policy: What Do the Models Tell Us?,"Very little. A plethora of integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been constructed and used to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC) and evaluate alternative abatement policies. These models have crucial flaws that make them close to useless as tools for policy analysis: certain inputs (e.g., the discount rate) are arbitrary, but have huge effects on the SCC estimates the models produce; the models' descriptions of the impact of climate change are completely ad hoc, with no theoretical or empirical foundation; and the models can tell us nothing about the most important driver of the SCC, the possibility of a catastrophic climate outcome.

Tail-Hedge Discounting and the Social Cost of Carbon,"The choice of an overall discount rate for climate change investments depends critically on how different components of investment payoffs are discounted at differing rates reflecting their underlying risk characteristics. Such underlying rates can vary enormously, from approximately equal to 1 percent for idiosyncratic diversifiable risk to approximately equal to 7 percent for systematic nondiversifiable risk. Which risk-adjusted rate is chosen can have a huge impact on cost-benefit analysis. In this expository paper, I attempt to set forth in accessible language with a simple linear model what I think are some of the basic issues involved in discounting climate risks. The paper introduces a new concept that may be relevant for climate-change discounting: the degree to which an investment hedges against the bad tail of catastrophic damages by insuring positive expected payoffs even under the worst circumstances. The prototype application is calculating the social cost of carbon.",,1438545501, 1393735,Scholarly Journals,,"Weitzman, Martin L",," Weitzman, Martin L", 10.1257/jel.51.3.873, Journal Article,, September 2013,,0022-0515,3, English, English, 873-882,September 2013,Journal of Economic Literature," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,51,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1438545501?accountid=14505," Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 51, no. 3, September 2013, pp. 873-82", [URL:http://www.aeaweb.org/jel/index.php] Publisher's URL, 873," Model Construction and Estimation (C51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Tail-Hedge+Discounting+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Journal+of+Economic+Literature&amp;issn=00220515&amp;date=2013-09-01&amp;volume=51&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=873&amp;au=Weitzman%2C+Martin+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Economic+Literature&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1393735&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1257%2Fjel.51.3.873,EconLit
The Economic Effects of Climate Change,"I review the literature on the economic impacts of climate change, an externality that is unprecedentedly large, complex, and uncertain. Only 14 estimates of the total damage cost of climate change have been published, a research effort that is in sharp contrast to the urgency of the public debate and the proposed expenditure on greenhouse gas emission reduction. These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is $50/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100. From a welfare perspective, the impact of climate change is problematic because population is endogenous, and because policy analyses should separate impatience, risk aversion, and inequity aversion between and within countries.",,56927963, 1038879,Scholarly Journals,,"Tol, Richard S J",," Tol, Richard S J", 10.1257/jep.23.2.29, Journal Article,, April 2009,,0895-3309,2, English, English, 29-51,April 2009,Journal of Economic Perspectives," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2009,, American Economic Association,23,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56927963?accountid=14505," Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 23, no. 2, Spring 2009, pp. 29-51", [URL:http://www.aeaweb.org/jep/] Publisher's URL, 29," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Selected Countries , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Economic+Effects+of+Climate+Change&amp;title=Journal+of+Economic+Perspectives&amp;issn=08953309&amp;date=2009-04-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=29&amp;au=Tol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Economic+Perspectives&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1038879&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1257%2Fjep.23.2.29,EconLit
Quantifying Economic Damages from Climate Change,"Climate scientists have spent billions of dollars and eons of supercomputer time studying how increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and changes in the reflectivity of the earth's surface affect dimensions of the climate system relevant to human society: surface temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sea levels. Recent incarnations of physical climate models have become sophisticated enough to be able to simulate intensities and frequencies of some extreme events, like tropical storms, under different warming scenarios. In a stark juxtaposition, the efforts involved in and the public resources targeted at understanding how these physical changes translate into economic impacts are disproportionately smaller, with most of the major models being developed and maintained with little to no public funding support. The goal of this paper is first to shed light on how (mostly) economists have gone about calculating the ""social cost of carbon"" for regulatory purposes and to provide an overview of the past and currently used estimates. In the second part, I will focus on where empirical economists may have the highest value added in this enterprise: specifically, the calibration and estimation of economic damage functions, which map weather patterns transformed by climate change into economic benefits and damages. A broad variety of econometric methods have recently been used to parameterize the dose (climate) response (economic outcome) functions. The paper seeks to provide an accessible and comprehensive overview of how economists think about parameterizing damage functions and quantifying the economic damages of climate change.",,2127943158, 1737825,Scholarly Journals,,"Auffhammer, Maximilian",," Auffhammer, Maximilian", 10.1257/jep.32.4.33, Journal Article,, October 2018,,0895-3309,4, English, English, 33-52,October 2018,Journal of Economic Perspectives," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,32,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2127943158?accountid=14505," Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 32, no. 4, Fall 2018, pp. 33-52", [URL:http://www.aeaweb.org/jep/] Publisher's URL, 33," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Quantifying+Economic+Damages+from+Climate+Change&amp;title=Journal+of+Economic+Perspectives&amp;issn=08953309&amp;date=2018-10-01&amp;volume=32&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=33&amp;au=Auffhammer%2C+Maximilian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Economic+Perspectives&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1737825&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1257%2Fjep.32.4.33,EconLit
"Federal Coal Program Reform, the Clean Power Plan, and the Interaction of Upstream and Downstream Climate Policies","Can supply-side environmental policies that limit the extraction of fossil fuels reduce CO2 emissions? This paper studies interactions between a specific supply-side policy--a carbon surcharge on federal coal royalties--and regulation of emissions from the power sector under the Clean Air Act. Estimates from a detailed dynamic model of the power sector suggest that, absent new downstream regulation, a royalty surcharge equal to the social cost of carbon would generate three-quarters of the emissions reductions originally projected for the Clean Power Plan (CPP), with an average abatement cost roughly equal to the social cost of carbon. Were the CPP in place, the royalty surcharge would reduce emissions by reducing leakage and causing the CPP to be nonbinding in some scenarios.",,2352980483, 1809278,Scholarly Journals," Cornell U , Audi of America, Sacramento , Harvard U","Gerarden, Todd D;Reeder, W Spencer;Stock, James H",," Gerarden, Todd D", 10.1257/pol.20160246, Journal Article, 1945-774X, February 2020,,1945-7731,1, English, English, 167-199,February 2020,American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, CSAPTjournals,2020,, American Economic Association,12,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2352980483?accountid=14505," American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 167-199", [URL:http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-policy/] Publisher's URL, 167," Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate , Fuel , Regulation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Federal+Coal+Program+Reform%2C+the+Clean+Power+Plan%2C+and+the+Interaction+of+Upstream+and+Downstream+Climate+Policies&amp;title=American+Economic+Journal%3A+Economic+Policy&amp;issn=19457731&amp;date=2020-02-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=167&amp;au=Gerarden%2C+Todd+D%3BReeder%2C+W+Spencer%3BStock%2C+James+H&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Economic+Journal%3A+Economic+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1809278&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1257%2Fpol.20160246,EconLit
Optimal Climate Policy When Damages Are Unknown,"Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are economists' primary tool for analyzing the optimal carbon tax. Damage functions, which link temperature to economic impacts, have come under fire because of their assumptions that may be incorrect in significant but a priori unknowable ways. Here I develop recursive IAM frameworks to model uncertainty, learning, and concern for misspecification about damages. I decompose the carbon tax into channels capturing state uncertainty, insurance motives, and precautionary saving. Damage learning improves ex ante welfare by 750 billion USD. If damage functions are misspecified and omit the potential for catastrophic damages, robust control may be beneficial ex post.",,2388296809, 1826592,Scholarly Journals, Cornell U,"Rudik, Ivan",," Rudik, Ivan", 10.1257/pol.20160541, Journal Article, 1945-774X, May 2020,,1945-7731,2, English, English, 340-373,May 2020,American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, CSAPTjournals,2020,, American Economic Association,12,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2388296809?accountid=14505," American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 340-373", [URL:http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-policy/] Publisher's URL, 340," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Climate+Policy+When+Damages+Are+Unknown&amp;title=American+Economic+Journal%3A+Economic+Policy&amp;issn=19457731&amp;date=2020-05-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=340&amp;au=Rudik%2C+Ivan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Economic+Journal%3A+Economic+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1826592&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1257%2Fpol.20160541,EconLit
Watch Your Step: Optimal Policy in a Tipping Climate,"We investigate the optimal policy response to the possibility of abrupt, irreversible shifts in system dynamics. The welfare cost of a tipping point emerges from the policymaker's response to altered system dynamics. Our policymaker also learns about a threshold's location by observing the system's response in each period. Simulations with a recursive, numerical climate-economy model show that tipping possibilities raise the optimal carbon tax more strongly over time. The resulting policy paths ultimately lower optimal peak warming by up to 0.5 degrees C.

Climate Risks and Carbon Prices: Revising the Social Cost of Carbon,"The social cost of carbon--or marginal damage caused by an additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions--has been estimated by a U.S. government working group at $21/tCO2 in 2010. That calculation, however, omits many of the biggest risks associated with climate change, and downplays the impact of current emissions on future generations. Our reanalysis explores the effects of uncertainty about climate sensitivity, the shape of the damage function, and the discount rate. We show that the social cost of carbon is uncertain across a broad range, and could be much higher than $21/tCO2. In our case combining high climate sensitivity, high damages, and a low discount rate, the social cost of carbon could be almost $900/tCO2 in 2010, rising to $1,500/tCO2 in 2050. The most ambitious scenarios for eliminating carbon dioxide emissions as rapidly as technologically feasible (reaching zero or negative net global emissions by the end of this century) require spending up to $150 to $500 per ton of reductions of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Using a reasonable set of alternative assumptions, therefore, the damages from a ton of carbon dioxide emissions in 2050 could exceed the cost of reducing emissions at the maximum technically feasible rate. Once this is the case, the exact value of the social cost of carbon loses importance: the clear policy prescription is to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible, and cost-effectiveness analysis offers better insights for climate policy than cost-benefit analysis.",1,1030495484, 1304884,Scholarly Journals,,"Ackerman, Frank;Stanton, Elizabeth A",," Ackerman, Frank",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2012",,1864-6042,, English, English,,"0, 2012","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2012,, American Economic Association,6,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030495484?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 6, 2012", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Risks+and+Carbon+Prices%3A+Revising+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ackerman%2C+Frank%3BStanton%2C+Elizabeth+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1304884&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Sector 1 can reduce its carbon emissions at a reasonable cost thanks to a CCS device. Sector 2 has access only to air capture technology, but at a significantly higher cost. We assume that the atmospheric carbon stock cannot exceed a given ceiling. We show that the optimal approach consists in, first, fully capturing sector-1 emissions before the ceiling is reached and, second, deploying air capture to partially abate sector-2 emissions.

Equity Weighting and the Marginal Damage Costs of Climate Change,"Climate change would impact different countries differently, and different countries have different levels of development. Equity-weighted estimates of the (marginal) impact of greenhouse gas emissions reflect these differences. Equity-weighted estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions are substantially higher than estimates without equity-weights; equity-weights may also change the sign of the social cost estimates. Equity weights need to be normalised. Our estimates differ by two orders of magnitude depending on the region of normalisation. A discounting error of equity weighted social cost of carbon estimates in earlier work (Tol, Energy Journal, 1999), led to an error of a factor two. Equity-weighted estimates are sensitive to the resolution of the impact estimates. Depending on the assumed intra-regional income distribution, estimates may be more than twice as high if national rather than regional impacts are aggregated. The assumed scenario is important too, not only because different scenarios have different emissions and hence warming, but also because different scenarios have different income differences, different growth rates, and different vulnerabilities. Because of this, variations in the assumed inequity aversion have little effect on the marginal damage cost in some scenarios, and a large effect in other scenarios.",1,56691606, 0908928,Working Papers,,"Anthoff, David;Hepburn, Cameron;Tol, Richard S J"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Anthoff, David",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2007",,,, English, English,,"0, 2007","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2007.43, 2007", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2007," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2007.43"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2007.43",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56691606?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2007.43, 2007", [URL:http://www.feem.it/NR/rdonlyres/246E0B9B-9399-49B7-A2E8-39D7EDD5E2E9/2319/4307.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Marginal Damage Costs, Climate Change, Equity",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Equity+Weighting+and+the+Marginal+Damage+Costs+of+Climate+Change&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anthoff%2C+David%3BHepburn%2C+Cameron%3BTol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0908928&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Discounting for Climate Change,"It is well-known that the discount rate is crucially important for estimating the social cost of carbon, a standard indicator for the seriousness of climate change and desirable level of climate policy. The Ramsey equation for the discount rate has three components: the pure rate of time preference, a measure of relative risk aversion, and the rate of growth of per capita consumption. Much of the attention on the appropriate discount rate for long-term environmental problems has focused on the role played by the pure rate of time preference in this formulation. We show that the other two elements are numerically just as important in considerations of anthropogenic climate change. The elasticity of the marginal utility with respect to consumption is particularly important because it assumes three roles: consumption smoothing over time, risk aversion, and inequity aversion. Given the large uncertainties about climate change and widely asymmetric impacts, the assumed rates of risk and inequity aversion can be expected to play significant roles. The consumption growth rate plays multiple roles, as well. It is one of the determinants of the discount rate, and one of the drivers of emissions and hence climate change. We also find that the impacts of climate change grow slower than income, so the effective discount rate is higher than the real discount rate. Moreover, the differential growth rate between rich and poor countries determines the time evolution of the size of the equity weights. As there are a number of crucial but uncertain parameters, it is no surprise that one can obtain almost any estimate of the social cost of carbon. We even show that, for a low pure rate of time preference, the estimate of the social cost of carbon is indeed arbitrary--as one can exclude neither large positive nor large negative impacts in the very long run. However, if we probabilistically constrain the parameters to values that are implied by observed behaviour, we find that the expected social cost of carbon, corrected for uncertainty and inequity, is approximate $60 US per metric tonne of carbon (or roughly $17 per tonne of CO2) under the assumption that catastrophic risk is zero.",0,56947519, 1052229,Scholarly Journals,,"Anthoff, David;Tol, Richard S J;Yohe, Gary W",," Anthoff, David",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2009",,1864-6042,, English, English,,"0, 2009","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2009,, American Economic Association,3,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56947519?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 3, 2009", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL,," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Discounting+for+Climate+Change&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anthoff%2C+David%3BTol%2C+Richard+S+J%3BYohe%2C+Gary+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1052229&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Coping with the Climate Crisis: Mitigation Policies and Global Coordination,"Twelve papers, emerging from the September 2016 conference, ""The Energy Transition, NDCs, and the Post-COP21"" held in Marrakesh, synthesize key insights that have emerged from recent economic research on climate change. Papers discuss reducing energy greenhouse gas emissions to meet climate goals; transitional risks and the safe carbon budget; fighting climate change and the social cost of carbon; the pricing of fossil fuels; whether carbon pricing should be different across countries; the need for robust control in climate economics; improving the Paris Agreement through credibility, technology, and conservation; whether a uniform carbon-price commitment can help resolve the global warming problem; the role of the International Monetary Fund in addressing climate change; post-Paris clean energy options for China; financing sustainable infrastructure; and a policy-making case study of capital markets' mobilization for public good.

The Temporal Aspects of the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the temporal aspects of the social cost of greenhouse gases (GHGs), that is, timing of emissions, discounting, type of GHG (where different GHGs have different atmospheric lifetimes), and the influence of calculation period on model results. I show graphically how the social costs of GHGs depend on different parameter values and how the global damage potentials for methane and sulfur hexafluoride evolve over time. I find that the calculation period ultimately should be modeled to be consistent with the discount rate and that the ""global-warming potential"" concept is unsuitable for calculating the social cost of GHGs other than carbon dioxide.

Forecasting of Carbon Emissions Prices by the Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System,"The need for accurate forecasts has increased in recent years but there has as yet been limited research on carbon emissions price trends. This study uses the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model to forecast the price trends of carbon emissions: ANFIS is a hybrid system consisting of neural networks and fuzzy logic. It uses a combination of the least-squares method and the back-propagation gradient descent method to estimate the optimal carbon price forecast parameters. Although the system is well known, it has been modified in order to best process the carbon emissions data sets. We used daily data sets covering the period from October 14, 2009 to October 29, 2013, using 1074 observations to train and evaluate the model. The results of the simulation and experimental investigations carried out in the laboratory showed that the model is suitable for forecasting carbon emissions price trends. A further evaluation compared the returns from trading actions, according to the signal of the forecasted system, with the buy-and-hold strategy.",1,1761437947, 1541068,Scholarly Journals,,"Atsalakis, G;Frantzis, D;Zopounidis, C",," Atsalakis, G",, Journal Article,, September 2015,,1756-3607,3, English, English, 55-68,September 2015,Journal of Energy Markets," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,8,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1761437947?accountid=14505," Journal of Energy Markets, vol. 8, no. 3, September 2015, pp. 55-68", [URL:http://www.risk.net/type/journal/source/journal-of-energy-markets] Publisher's URL, 55," Forecasting Models, Simulation Methods (C53) , Contingent Pricing, Futures Pricing, option pricing (G13) , Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels (L71) , Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Europe , Europe , Forecast , Forecasting , Simulation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Forecasting+of+Carbon+Emissions+Prices+by+the+Adaptive+Neuro-fuzzy+Inference+System&amp;title=Journal+of+Energy+Markets&amp;issn=17563607&amp;date=2015-09-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=55&amp;au=Atsalakis%2C+G%3BFrantzis%2C+D%3BZopounidis%2C+C&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Energy+Markets&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1541068&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Climate Shocks, Cyclones, and Economic Growth: Bridging the Micro-Macro Gap","Empirical analyses of the impacts of climatic shocks on growth, while critical for policy, have found seemingly disparate results and are seldom incorporated into macroeconomic climate-economy models. This paper seeks to bridge this micro-macro gap through the case of tropical cyclones. We first present a stochastic endogenous growth model that can reconcile previous empirical findings. We then empirically estimate the impacts of cyclones on the structural determinants of growth (total factor productivity, depreciation, fatalities), instead of growth itself, facilitating direct inclusion into the seminal DICE climate-economy model. Cyclone damages are estimated to increase the social cost of carbon by 10-15%.",0,2118307288, 1732807,Working Papers,,"Bakkensen, Laura;Barrage, Lint"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Bakkensen, Laura",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2018",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2018",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2018," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 24893"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 24893",w24893,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2118307288?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 24893, 2018", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w24893.pdf] URL,," Environment and Growth (O44) , Empirical Studies of Economic Growth, Aggregate Productivity, Cross-Country Output Convergence (O47) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Shocks%2C+Cyclones%2C+and+Economic+Growth%3A+Bridging+the+Micro-Macro+Gap&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=w24893&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bakkensen%2C+Laura%3BBarrage%2C+Lint&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1732807&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
To Build or Not to Build? Capital Stocks and Climate Policy,"We investigate how irreversibility in ""dirty"" and ""clean"" capital stocks affects optimal climate policy, from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. An increasing carbon tax will reduce investments in assets that pollute, and so reduce emissions in the short term: our ""irreversibility effect"". As such the ""Green Paradox"" has a converse if we focus on demand side capital stock effects. We also show that the optimal subsidy increases with the deployment rate: our ""acceleration effect"".

Carbon Sequestration in the U.S. National Parks: A Value beyond Visitation,"Carbon sequestration--the process of moderating global climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in long-term mineral, organic, and oceanic reservoirs--is an important ecosystem service provided by protected natural areas. One type of carbon sequestration that has received attention in recent years is vegetative carbon sequestration, which is the sequestration provided through plant growth. While a number of countries have developed estimates of their national vegetative carbon sequestration capacity, no estimate exists for the National Park Service (NPS) administered areas, 85% of which are vegetated. This paper addresses that knowledge gap. Using federally created, peer-reviewed work on carbon sequestration rates based on a 5-year baseline period (2001-2005) of observed data, NPS boundary data, and landcover types, the study calculates the current tonnage and economic value of vegetative carbon sequestration services on all NPS units located in the continental U.S. Average projected sequestration amounts for the period 2006-2050 are also provided based on modeled data. Using conservative assumptions, we find that at present average annual carbon sequestration on NPS lands amounts to 17.5 million metric tons of CO2, valued at $707 million dollars using the current federal interagency working group social cost of carbon damage price of $40.45/metric ton. In the future years through 2050, absent any changes in land management (such as invasive species removal or fire management) carbon sequestration is predicted to fall by 31% to an average of 12.0 million metric tons of CO2 sequestered annually, due to factors such as a warming climate, invasive species, and increased fire hazards. Given the benefits to society of avoiding this future loss in carbon sequestration, funding for management actions for the National Park Service may be economically justifiable in order to mitigate this decline, although further research is needed to better understand how specific NPS practices can maintain current carbon sequestration levels.",0,1700661931, 1508891,Working Papers,,"Banasiak, Adam;Bilmes, Linda J;Loomis, John"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Banasiak, Adam",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2015",,,, English, English,,"0, 2015","Harvard University, John F.

Price of Long-Run Temperature Shifts in Capital Markets,"We use the forward-looking information from the US and global capital markets to estimate the economic impact of global warming, specifically, long-run temperature shifts. We find that global warming carries a positive risk premium that increases with the level of temperature and that has almost doubled over the last 80 years. Consistent with our model, virtually all US equity portfolios have negative exposure (beta) to long-run temperature fluctuations. The elasticity of equity prices to temperature risks across global markets is significantly negative and has been increasing in magnitude over time along with the rise in temperature. We use our empirical evidence to calibrate a long-run risks model with temperature-induced disasters in distant output growth to quantify the social cost of carbon emissions. The model simultaneously matches the projected temperature path, the observed consumption growth dynamics, discount rates provided by the risk-free rate and equity market returns, and the estimated temperature elasticity of equity prices.

Climate Change and Growth Risks,"To study the welfare implications of rising temperature we propose a temperature-augmented long-run risks model that accounts for the interaction between temperature, economic growth and risk. The model simultaneously matches the projected temperature path, the observed consumption growth dynamics, discount rates provided by the risk-free rate and equity market returns, and the negative elasticity of equity prices to temperature risks documented in the data. We use the calibrated model to quantify the social cost of carbon (SCC) and to frame the optimal climate policy.

Optimal Dynamic Carbon Taxes in a Climate-Economy Model with Distortionary Fiscal Policy,"How should carbon be taxed as a part of fiscal policy? The literature on optimal carbon pricing often abstracts from other taxes. However, when governments raise revenues with distortionary taxes, carbon levies have fiscal impacts. While they raise revenues directly, they may shrink the bases of other taxes (e.g. by decreasing employment). This article theoretically characterizes and then quantifies optimal carbon taxes in a dynamic general equilibrium climate-economy model with distortionary fiscal policy. First, this article establishes a novel theoretical relationship between the optimal taxation of carbon and of capital income. This link arises because carbon emissions destroy natural capital: they accumulate in the atmosphere and decrease future output. Consequently, this article shows how the standard logic against capital income taxes extends to distortions on environmental capital investments. Second, this article characterizes optimal climate policy in sub-optimal fiscal settings where income taxes are constrained to remain at their observed levels. Third, this article presents a detailed calibration that builds on the seminal DICE approach but adds features essential for a setting with distortionary taxes, such as a differentiation between climate change production impacts (e.g. on agriculture) and direct utility impacts (e.g. on biodiversity existence value). The central quantitative finding is that optimal carbon tax schedules are 8-24% lower when there are distortionary taxes, compared to the setting with lump-sum taxes considered in the literature.",1,2432404050, 1845992,Scholarly Journals, Brown U,"Barrage, Lint",," Barrage, Lint",, Journal Article, 1467-937X, January 2020,,0034-6527,1, English, English, 1-39,January 2020,Review of Economic Studies, CSAPTjournals,2020,, American Economic Association,87,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2432404050?accountid=14505," Review of Economic Studies, vol. 87, no. 1, pp. 1-39", [URL:https://academic.oup.com/restud/issue] Publisher's URL, 1," Fiscal Policy (E62) , Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Fiscal Policy , Optimal Taxation , Policy , Revenue , Tax , Taxation , Taxes",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Dynamic+Carbon+Taxes+in+a+Climate-Economy+Model+with+Distortionary+Fiscal+Policy&amp;title=Review+of+Economic+Studies&amp;issn=00346527&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=87&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Barrage%2C+Lint&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Review+of+Economic+Studies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1845992&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
On Green Growth with Sustainable Capital,"We develop an endogenous growth model to address a long standing question whether sustainable green growth is feasible by re-allocating resource use between green (natural) and man-made (carbon intensive) capital. Although the model is general we relate it to the UK's green growth policy objective. In our model, final output is produced with two reproducible inputs, green and man-made capital. The growth of man-made capital causes depreciation of green capital via carbon emissions and related externalities which the private sector does not internalize. A benevolent government uses carbon taxes to encourage firms to substitute man-made capital with green capital in so far the production technology allows. Doing so, the damage to natural capital by emissions can be partly reversed through a lower socially optimal long run growth. The trade-off between environmental quality and long-run growth can be overcome by a pollution abatement technology intervention. However, if the source of pollution is consumption, the optimal carbon tax is zero and there is no trade-off between environment policy and growth. A corrective consumption tax is then needed to finance a public investment programme for replenishing the green capital destroyed by consumption based emissions.",0,2412515500, 1836273,Working Papers,,"Basu, Parantap;Jamasb, Tooraj",," Basu, Parantap",, Working Paper,, 2020,,,, English, English,,2020,, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2020," Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics"," American Economic Association  Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2412515500?accountid=14505,, [URL:http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/research-files/repec/cam/pdf/cwpe2044.pdf] URL,," General Aggregative Models: General (E10) , Innovation, Research and Development, Technological Change, Intellectual Property Rights: General (O30) , Economic Growth and Aggregate Productivity: General (O40) , Renewable Resources and Conservation: General (Q20) , Green growth, sustainability, carbon tax, clean growth, resource substitution",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=On+Green+Growth+with+Sustainable+Capital&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Basu%2C+Parantap%3BJamasb%2C+Tooraj&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1836273&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
On the Path of an Oil Pigovian Tax,"This paper studies optimal climate policy in the presence of oil rents. Several authors have found that, according to Hotelling's rule, in the long run, the optimal ad valorem tax must decrease. However, if the pollution is a stock and if environmental concerns impose stopping the resource extraction before its exhaustion, we show that an ad valorem tax defined over the rent cannot decentralize the optimum. In this case, an increasing per-unit tax can decentralize the optimum. Such a tax implies the disappearance of the Hotelling rent. Thus, the extraction problem reduces to a pollution-control problem.",1,56978822, 1064484,Scholarly Journals,,"Belgodere, Antoine",," Belgodere, Antoine",, Journal Article, 1467-9957, September 2009,,1463-6786,5, English, English, 632-649,September 2009,Manchester School," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2009,, American Economic Association,77,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56978822?accountid=14505," Manchester School, vol. 77, no. 5, September 2009, pp. 632-49", [URL:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291467-9957/issues] Publisher's URL, 632," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Pollution , Pollution Control , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=On+the+Path+of+an+Oil+Pigovian+Tax&amp;title=Manchester+School&amp;issn=14636786&amp;date=2009-09-01&amp;volume=77&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=632&amp;au=Belgodere%2C+Antoine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Manchester+School&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1064484&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Economic Damages from Climate Change: A Review of Modeling Approaches,"This report elucidates one aspect of economic IAMs: the damage function. Damage functions map environmental changes (primarily mean temperature increases) to economic impacts. This crucial step in the determination of SCC appears in very different form in the leading economic IAMs. Through sections 3, 4, and 5 we review, in turn, the damage functions of the Dynamic Integrated Model of Climate and the Economy (DICE), the Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) and the Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE). Section 6 discusses some empirical, programmatic and conceptual limitations of these three IAMs. Section 7 concludes.

Climate Policy without Intertemporal Dictatorship: Chichilnisky Criterion versus Classical Utilitarianism in DICE,"Unlike discounting and the damage function, the social welfare function has not received so much attention in the debate on climate economics. An important challenge has been to combine efficiency and equity considerations in a single social welfare framework. The Chichilnisky criterion is one way to resolve this. We consider its implementation in the climate-economy model Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE), and compare results for different damage functions, namely the standard one in DICE and the one proposed by Weitzman implying potential large climate damages at high temperature increases. We calculate optimal climate policy for different parameter settings and compare the results with those under the green golden rule (only final utility matters) and classical utilitarianism (no discounting). Optimal emission abatement trajectories turn out to be very different between standard discounted utilitarianism, classical utilitarianism and Chichilnisky specifications. The results are very sensitive to the damage function, the climate sensitivity parameter and especially the ""Chichilnisky weight"" given to utility of generations in the far future. We discuss conditions and reasons for preferring either classical utilitarianism or the Chichilnisky criterion, and conclude that a critical factor is the time horizon used in climate policy analysis. Adopting sustainable preferences as formalized by the Chichilnisky criterion in climate policy analysis has the advantage that the very long-term implications of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on the environment and human welfare are not downplayed.",1,2083702548, 1719423,Scholarly Journals,,"Botzen, W J Wouter;Van Den Bergh, Jeroen C J M;Chichilnisky, Graciela",," Botzen, W J Wouter",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, May 2018,,2010-0078,2, English, English, 1-17,May 2018,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,9,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2083702548?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 9, no. 2, May 2018, pp. 1-17", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Environment and Growth (O44) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate , Environment",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Policy+without+Intertemporal+Dictatorship%3A+Chichilnisky+Criterion+versus+Classical+Utilitarianism+in+DICE&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2018-05-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Botzen%2C+W+J+Wouter%3BVan+Den+Bergh%2C+Jeroen+C+J+M%3BChichilnisky%2C+Graciela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1719423&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Natural Gas Prices, Electric Generation Investment, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Between 2007 and 2013 the natural gas price dramatically declined, in large part due to hydraulic fracturing. These lower natural gas prices induced switching from coal generation to natural gas generation. I find that switching caused 2013 carbon emissions to fall by 14,700 tons/h. Lower gas prices also incentivized new investment in natural gas capacity. This less carbon-intensive capital stock led to an additional decrease of 2,100 tons/h in 2013. Using three approaches, I estimate that 65-85% of new capacity was constructed because of lower gas prices.

As the world moves to understand and implement country emissions reduction pledges in the context of the UNFCCC, understanding the economics of the problem will become even more important.

Essays on Public and Environmental Economics,"Over the last 10 years, the solar photovoltaic (PV) market has experienced tremendous growth due in part to government incentive programs. However the effect and welfare analysis of these policy instruments remain ambiguous. In the first chapter of my dissertation, we estimate a dynamic model of households investment decisions on rooftop PV systems to understand the impact of these programs on residential solar installations and evaluate the outcome of alternative incentive policies. The model separately evaluates the effect of system prices, up-front subsidies, tax credits and production revenues using a 5-year data set collected by the California Solar Initiative program, which subsidized solar installations in California. The results indicate that capacity-based subsidies are equally effective as production-based subsidies, but that the latter are more efficient. With a $100 social cost of carbon, the total subsidies in California would be welfare neutral. If California were only as sunny as Frankfurt, Germany, this value has to be $200 to be welfare neutral. We find that without subsidies, 85% of the existing installations would not have occurred. The second chapter of my dissertation is on the political economics of corruption. This is a relevant question in the Environmental Economics due to the human factors involved in government regulations. We investigate the effects of unhindered corruption in the entry-certifying process of an industry on market structure and social welfare. To gain entry, a firm must pay a bribe-maximizing official an exogenous percentage of anticipated profit, in addition to the usual set up cost. This would lead to a monopoly, but only in markets without pre-existing firms. A benevolent social planner may use bribery to the benefit of society by either manipulating the number of pre-existing firms in the market, or by setting up independent (corrupt) licensing authorities. A socially optimal number of firms in the market may be reached by choosing the right number of pre-existing firms or by having exactly two licensing authorities. These mechanisms may be seen as restoring second-best efficiency in settings characterized by two major sources of distortion: Imperfect competition and corruption.",0,1492589248, 1404911,Dissertations & Theses,,"Burr, Chrystie",," Burr, Chrystie",, Dissertation,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","University of Arizona, 2013", CSAPTdissertations,2013, University of Arizona, American Economic Association  University of Arizona,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1492589248?accountid=14505," University of Arizona, 2013",,," Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior (D72) , Illegal Behavior and the Enforcement of Law (K42) , Electric Utilities (L94) , Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy (L98) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , U.S. , Northern America , Bribe , Bribery , Corruption , Environmental Economics , Government , Political , Regulation , Rights",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:EconLit&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+Public+and+Environmental+Economics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burr%2C+Chrystie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1404911&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Strategic Policy Choice in State-Level Regulation: The EPA's Clean Power Plan,"Flexibility in environmental regulations can lead to reduced costs if it allows additional abatement from lower cost sources or if policy tailoring and experimentation across states increases regulatory efficiency. The EPA's 2014 Clean Power Plan, which implements greenhouse gas regulation of power plants under the Clean Air Act, allows substantial regulatory flexibility. The Clean Power Plan sets state-level 2030 goals for emissions rates (in lbs CO2 per MWh) with substantial variation in the goals across states. The Clean Power Plan allows states considerable flexibility in attaining these goals. In particular, states can choose whether to implement the rate standards goals or equivalent mass-based goals (i.e., emissions cap and trade, CAT). Moreover, states can choose whether or not to join with other states in implementing their goals. We analyze incentives to adopt inefficient rate standards versus efficient CAT standards using both analytical and simulation models. We have five main results. First, we theoretically show that industry supply can be efficient under both CAT regulation and rate-based regulation. However, under rate-based standards the carbon price must equal the social cost of carbon and the rate standard must be equal across all the states. Second, we illustrate important differences in the incentives of a unified coalition of states and the incentives of a single state. Third, our simulation results show that when states fail to coordinate on a policy, the merit order can be ""scrambled"" quite dramatically leading to significant inefficiencies.

Climate Policy under Cooperation and Competition between Regions with Spatial Heat Transport,"We build a novel stochastic dynamic regional integrated assessment model (IAM) of the climate and economic system including a number of important climate science elements that are missing in most IAMs. These elements are spatial heat transport from the Equator to the Poles, sea level rise, permafrost thaw and tipping points. We study optimal policies under cooperation and various degrees of competition between regions.

Environmental Tipping Points Significantly Affect the Cost-Benefit Assessment of Climate Policies,"Most current cost-benefit analyses of climate change policies suggest an optimal global climate policy that is significantly less stringent than the level required to meet the internationally agreed 2 degrees Celsius target. This is partly because the sum of estimated economic damage of climate change across various sectors, such as energy use and changes in agricultural production, results in only a small economic loss or even a small economic gain in the gross world product under predicted levels of climate change. However, those cost-benefit analyses rarely take account of environmental tipping points leading to abrupt and irreversible impacts on market and nonmarket goods and services, including those provided by the climate and by ecosystems. Here we show that including environmental tipping point impacts in a stochastic dynamic integrated assessment model profoundly alters cost-benefit assessment of global climate policy. The risk of a tipping point, even if it only has nonmarket impacts, could substantially increase the present optimal carbon tax. For example, a risk of only 5% loss in nonmarket goods that occurs with a 5% annual probability at a 4 degrees Celsius increase of the global surface temperature causes an immediate two-thirds increase in optimal carbon tax. If the tipping point also has a 5% impact on market goods, the optimal carbon tax increases by more than a factor of 3. Hence existing cost-benefit assessments of global climate policy may be significantly underestimating the needs for controlling climate change.",1,2001400079, 1682304,Scholarly Journals,,"Cai, Yongyang;Judd, Kenneth L;Lenton, Timothy M;Lontzek, Thomas S;Narita, Daiju",," Cai, Yongyang",, Journal Article, 1091-6490, April 2015,,0027-8424,15, English, English, 4606-4611,April 2015,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,112,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2001400079?accountid=14505," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 112, no. 15, April 2015, pp. 4606-11", [URL:http://www.pnas.org/content/by/section/Economic%20Sciences] Publisher's URL, 4606," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Cost Benefit , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Environmental+Tipping+Points+Significantly+Affect+the+Cost-Benefit+Assessment+of+Climate+Policies&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&amp;issn=00278424&amp;date=2015-04-01&amp;volume=112&amp;issue=15&amp;spage=4606&amp;au=Cai%2C+Yongyang%3BJudd%2C+Kenneth+L%3BLenton%2C+Timothy+M%3BLontzek%2C+Thomas+S%3BNarita%2C+Daiju&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1682304&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Double Counting in Supply Chain Carbon Footprinting,"Carbon footprinting is a tool for firms to determine the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with their supply chain or with a unit of final product or service. Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics- and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting.",0,1531429019, 1436622,Scholarly Journals,,"Caro, Felipe;Corbett, Charles J;Tan, Tarkan;Zuidwijk, Rob",," Caro, Felipe",, Journal Article, 1526-5498, October 2013,,1523-4614,4, English, English, 545-558,October 2013,Manufacturing and Service Operations Management," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,15,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1531429019?accountid=14505," Manufacturing and Service Operations Management, vol. 15, no. 4, Fall 2013, pp. 545-58", [URL:http://msom.journal.informs.org/content/by/year] Publisher's URL, 545," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Transactional Relationships, Contracts and Reputation, Networks (L14) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Contracts , Firm , Firms , Joint Production , Supply Chain , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Double+Counting+in+Supply+Chain+Carbon+Footprinting&amp;title=Manufacturing+and+Service+Operations+Management&amp;issn=15234614&amp;date=2013-10-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=545&amp;au=Caro%2C+Felipe%3BCorbett%2C+Charles+J%3BTan%2C+Tarkan%3BZuidwijk%2C+Rob&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Manufacturing+and+Service+Operations+Management&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1436622&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Taxing CO2 Emissions and Its Ancillary Health Benefits: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis for Tunisia,"Since the middle of the last century, Tunisia has embarked on an ambitious trade reform program aimed at improving its integration in the world economy, boosting growth through valorizing comparative advantages, and reducing unemployment among its population. However, and despite the positive role that trade may play in improving growth through better allocation of domestic resources and lower costs of imported equipments and raw materials, the risk is to amplify output in sectors intensive in energy in a country where energy is still subsidized. Introducing pollution abatement taxation has been suggested as a way to achieve ancillary benefits from reduced local air toxins. The highest level of local air pollution is found in heavily populated cities where labor is concentrated and where labor health is believed to have been significantly impacted. The objective of this paper is to address this important issue. It identifies the optimal and 'no regrets' pollution abatement tax on a net welfare function, which integrates both net health benefits and adjustment costs. The paper uses a Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the assessment that allows the health benefits to feed back into the economy. A health effects sub-model takes the local air emissions output from the CGE model and assesses the implications for ambient air concentration levels and health effects. The results suggest an 'optimal' abatement rate in 2020 of around 25% of CO2 reduction compared with the baseline 2020 emissions. However, the most significant impact concerns the relatively small aggregate cost of pollution abatement in terms of forgone real average growth rate of GDP between 2010 and 2020 for the trade scenario with 'optimal' climate policy. Finally, the major consequence of pollution abatement policies is the reduction of production generated by polluting activities against a higher production of less-polluting activities.",1,2059017082, 1708562,Scholarly Journals,,"Chemingui, Mohamed Abdelbasset;Thabet, Chokri",," Chemingui, Mohamed Abdelbasset",, Journal Article, 1793-8171,"  0, 2014",,1793-8120,1, English, English, 108-145,"0, 2014",Middle East Development Journal," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,6,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2059017082?accountid=14505," Middle East Development Journal, vol. 6, no. 1, 2014, pp. 108-45", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rmdj20#.UvzjOl46HLk] Publisher's URL, 108," Computable and Other Applied General Equilibrium Models (D58) , Health Behavior (I12) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Economic Development: Human Resources, Human Development, Income Distribution, Migration (O15) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Tunisia , Africa , Air Pollution , Allocation , CGE , Climate , Computable General Equilibrium , Energy , Equilibrium , GDP , General Equilibrium , Health , Polluting , Pollution , Population , Resources , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Taxing+CO2+Emissions+and+Its+Ancillary+Health+Benefits%3A+A+Computable+General+Equilibrium+Analysis+for+Tunisia&amp;title=Middle+East+Development+Journal&amp;issn=17938120&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=108&amp;au=Chemingui%2C+Mohamed+Abdelbasset%3BThabet%2C+Chokri&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Middle+East+Development+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1708562&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Subsidizing Fuel Efficient Cars: Evidence from China's Automobile Industry,"The Chinese automobile market is the largest in the world with annual sales exceeding 20 million vehicles. The tremendous growth in sales--over 200 percent from 2008 to 2015--and concerns over local air quality have prompted China's policy makers to incentivize the adoption of more fuel efficient vehicles. We examine the response of vehicle purchase behavior to China's largest national subsidy program for fuel efficient vehicles during 2010 and 2011. Using variation from the program's eligibility cutoffs, we find that the program boosted sales for subsidized vehicle models, but that the program also created a substitution effect within highly fuel efficient vehicles and most subsidies went to inframarginal consumers. This substitution effect greatly reduces the cost effectiveness of the program. We calculate that the average cost per ton of carbon dioxide saved is over 82 USD, well above the social cost of carbon used in U.S. regulatory filings. Using the framework in Boomhower and Davis (2014) and accounting for local pollution benefits, we show that ignoring the substitution effect would lead one to conclude that the program is welfare enhancing, whereas in fact the marginal cost of the program exceeds the marginal benefit by almost as much as 300 percent. We also show that the program was not well-targeted; the effect of the subsidy on sales of fuel efficient vehicles was smaller in areas where consumers were more likely to purchase fuel inefficient models or were lower educated.",0,1883156846, 1629571,Working Papers,,"Chen, Chia-Wen;Hu, Wei-Min;Knittel, Christopher R"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Chen, Chia-Wen",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2017",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2017",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2017," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23045"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23045",w23045,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883156846?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23045, 2017", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w23045.pdf] URL,," Regulation and Industrial Policy: General (L50) , Transportation: General (L91) , Energy: General (Q40) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Subsidizing+Fuel+Efficient+Cars%3A+Evidence+from+China%27s+Automobile+Industry&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=w23045&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Chia-Wen%3BHu%2C+Wei-Min%3BKnittel%2C+Christopher+R&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1629571&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

The results indicate that increasing Knightian uncertainty accelerates climate policy, i.e. policymakers become more reluctant to postpone the timing of climate policies into the future.",1,896014193, 1256599,Working Papers,,"Chen, Yu-Fu;Funke, Michael;Glanemann, Nicole"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Chen, Yu-Fu",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2011",,,, English, English,,"0, 2011","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3516, 2011", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2011," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3516"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3516",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/896014193?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3516, 2011", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2011/wp-cesifo-2011-07/cesifo1_wp3516. pdf] URL,," Optimization Techniques, Programming Models, Dynamic Analysis (C61) , Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , climate change, Knightian uncertainty, Kappa ambiguity, real options",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Dark+Clouds+or+Silver+Linings%3F+Knightian+Uncertainty+and+Climate+Change&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Yu-Fu%3BFunke%2C+Michael%3BGlanemann%2C+Nicole&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1256599&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Combinatorial Innovation, Evidence from Patent Data, and Mandated Innovation","This dissertation explores the implications of a new model of knowledge production. In my model, researchers have access to a set of primitive knowledge elements that can be combined to form ideas, where a new combination is a new idea. Underlying parameters governing the connections between elements stochastically determine whether a given combination yields a useful idea (some elements tend to work well together, and others do not). These underlying parameters are unknown to researchers, but as they attempt to combine elements and create ideas, they observe signals which they use to improve their beliefs via Bayesian updating. I embed this production function into a simple model of research incentives, where a firms receive a reward for discovering new and useful combinations, but pay a cost to conduct research. I investigate empirically these predictions using a large dataset on US utility patents: all 8.3 million utility patents granted between 1836 and 2012. From this analysis, I find that the probability a pair of knowledge ""elements"" (now proxied by technology classifications assigned by patent examiners) will be combined in any given year is increasing in the number of past combinations, decreasing over time, and increasing when both elements in the pair are also used with many other elements. These predictions are consistent with my model. The same work also predicts that patenting activity is positively correlated with changes in researcher knowledge about the connections between elements, and negatively correlated with time. Using panel data on 429 technology classes, I find the growth rate of patents is falling over time, but that increases can be forecast from positive changes in connections between elements 1-5 years earlier, even after controlling for numerous other factors. In my second paper, I examine the characteristics of the optimal research strategy for a forward-looking researcher using the above framework. To characterize the optimal strategy, I examine two special cases that permit analytic solutions, as well as a set of 100 numerically solved cases. The optimal research strategy reproduces many stylized facts about the innovation process, including the initial dominance of applied research relative to basic research. The third paper of my dissertation examines the impact of environmental policy choice on innovation, when research is characterized by unobservable (to the policy-maker) variance in technological opportunity. I assume there exist two types of energy, clean and dirty, that are perfect substitutes but for their production costs and a negative externality from dirty energy. Innovators are expected profit maximizers, and their decision to expend resources on R&D depends on technological opportunity, as well as the policy of the government. We show the policy-maker's decision to use quota or price based incentives matters. Price based incentives such as a carbon tax are characterized by disperse outcomes, with more R&D resources expended when technological opportunity is high, and reduced amounts when technological opportunity is low. Quotas such as mandates, in contrast, lead to a more consistent level of R&D spending across differences in technological opportunity. Thus, price-based systems are more likely to deliver great technological advances or none at all, while mandates are more likely to deliver consistent incremental gains. Moreover, we also show an optimal carbon tax is likely to outperform any mandate in expected welfare terms, and has less information requirements.",0,1850754697, 1607021,Dissertations & Theses,,"Clancy, Matthew",," Clancy, Matthew",, Dissertation,,"  0, 2015",,,, English, English,,"0, 2015","Iowa State University, 2015", CSAPTdissertations,2015, Iowa State University, American Economic Association  Iowa State University,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1850754697?accountid=14505," Iowa State University, 2015",,," Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives (O31) , Intellectual Property and Intellectual Capital (O34) , U.S. , Northern America , Innovation , Technology",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:EconLit&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Combinatorial+Innovation%2C+Evidence+from+Patent+Data%2C+and+Mandated+Innovation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clancy%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1607021&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Mandates and the Incentive for Environmental Innovation,"Mandates, which establish minimum use quotas for certain goods, are becoming increasingly popular policy tools to promote renewable energy use. In addition to mitigating the pollution externality of conventional energy, clean energy mandates have the goal of promoting research and development (R&D) investments in renewable energy technology. But how well do mandates perform as innovation incentives? To address this question, we develop a partial equilibrium model to examine the R&D incentives induced by a mandate, and compare this policy to two benchmark situations: laissez faire and a carbon tax. Innovation is stochastic and the model permits an endogenous number of multiple innovators. We present both analytical results and conclusions based on numerical simulations. We find that the optimal mandate is larger than it would be without the prospect of innovation, that neglecting the outlook for innovation significantly reduces welfare, and that the optimal mandate is more sensitive to assumptions about the innovation process than an optimal carbon tax. Furthermore, we find that mandates create relatively strong incentives for R&D investment in low-quality innovations, but relatively weak incentives to invest in high-quality innovations. We also rank policies by expected welfare. An optimal carbon tax has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate, and both have higher expected welfare than laissez faire. Moreover, in our endogenous innovation setting, a stronger result obtains: a simple carbon tax equal to the damage from pollution (unadjusted for the prospect of innovation) has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate.",1,2022122751, 1693163,Scholarly Journals,,"Clancy, Matthew S;Moschini, GianCarlo",," Clancy, Matthew S",, Journal Article, 1467-8276, January 2018,,0002-9092,1, English, English, 198-219,January 2018,American Journal of Agricultural Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,100,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2022122751?accountid=14505," American Journal of Agricultural Economics, vol. 100, no. 1, January 2018, pp. 198-219", [URL:https://academic.oup.com/ajae/issue] Publisher's URL, 198," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Innovation and Invention: Processes and Incentives (O31) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Environmental Economics: Technological Innovation (Q55) , Energy , Externality , Innovation , Pollution , Tax , Technology",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Mandates+and+the+Incentive+for+Environmental+Innovation&amp;title=American+Journal+of+Agricultural+Economics&amp;issn=00029092&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=100&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=198&amp;au=Clancy%2C+Matthew+S%3BMoschini%2C+GianCarlo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=American+Journal+of+Agricultural+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1693163&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Managing Uncertain Climates: Some Guidance for Policy Makers and Researchers,"Climate change--and, by extension, climate policy--is beset with unknowns and unknowables. This ""Reflections"" article presents an overview of approaches to managing climate uncertainties, in the hopes of providing guidance for current policy decisions as well as future research. We propose the following guidance for policy makers: Treat climate change as a risk management problem; recognize that benefit-cost analysis is only the first of many steps in deciding on optimal climate policy; in assessing abatement choices, use a discount rate that declines over time; recognize the importance of framing, evidence, and connecting the dots; reward modesty. We suggest the following questions for consideration by researchers: Can we improve forecasting? Can we improve the way we address nonlinearities and possible irreversibilities? What other (sub)disciplines merit a closer look? How can we create the right incentives for updating and expanding economic damage functions and climate-economy models? What alternative decision criteria merit further exploration?

Real Option Value for New Measurements of Cloud Radiative Forcing,"One of the critical uncertainties in estimating future climate change is climate sensitivity. Climate sensitivity uncertainty is driven by uncertain low cloud feedback in the climate system. Low cloud feedback is very closely related to decadal changes in the effect of low clouds on reflected solar radiation or shortwave cloud radiative forcing. This study computes the real option value of higher accuracy cloud radiative forcing measurements using the Inter Agency Memo on the Social Cost of Carbon, thereby extending a previous study of real option value based on observing decadal rate of temperature rise. The real option values for measuring cloud radiative forcing are roughly double that of measuring decadal temperature rise. This reflects the fact that triggering on temperature generally occurs earlier with less pronounced differences between the new and existing observing systems.",0,1815661027, 1587424,Working Papers,,"Cooke, Roger M;Golub, Alexander;Wielicki, Bruce A;Mlynczak, Martin G;Young, David F;Baize, Rosemary R"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Cooke, Roger M",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2016",,,, English, English,,"0, 2016","Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers, 2016", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2016," Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers"," American Economic Association  Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1815661027?accountid=14505," Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers, 2016", [URL:http://www.rff.org/research/publications/real-option-value-new-measurements-cloud-radiative-forcing] URL,,,https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Real+Option+Value+for+New+Measurements+of+Cloud+Radiative+Forcing&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cooke%2C+Roger+M%3BGolub%2C+Alexander%3BWielicki%2C+Bruce+A%3BMlynczak%2C+Martin+G%3BYoung%2C+David+F%3BBaize%2C+Rosemary+R&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1587424&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Economic Feasibility of Anaerobic Digestion with Swine Operations,"Anaerobic digestion systems can reduce greenhouse gas emissions while turning waste products into energy. Past U.S. economic research on anaerobic digesters has studied dairy farms, but limited economic information is available on anaerobic digestion systems for swine. Net present values (NPVs) were calculated for biodigesters and covered lagoons under different coproduct and policy scenarios. With no government intervention, covered lagoons are more promising for swine operations than more capital-intensive biodigesters. As there is interest in subsidizing anaerobic digestion systems, subsidies equal to a $38/t social cost of carbon would provide positive NPVs.",1,2360026684, 1816283,Scholarly Journals," Oklahoma State U , Oklahoma State U , Oklahoma State U","Cowley, Cortney A;Brorsen, B Wade;Hamilton, Douglas W",," Cowley, Cortney A",, Journal Article,, February 2019,,1074-0708,1, English, English, 49-68,February 2019,Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics, CSAPTjournals,2019,, American Economic Association,51,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2360026684?accountid=14505," Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics, vol. 51, no. 1, pp. 49-68", [URL:http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayBackIssues?jid=AAE] Publisher's URL, 49," Land Ownership and Tenure, Land Reform, Land Use, Irrigation, Agriculture and Environment (Q15) , Agricultural R&D, Agricultural Technology, Biofuels, Agricultural Extension Services (Q16) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , U.S. , Northern America , Energy , Farms , Gas",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Economic+Feasibility+of+Anaerobic+Digestion+with+Swine+Operations&amp;title=Journal+of+Agricultural+and+Applied+Economics&amp;issn=10740708&amp;date=2019-02-01&amp;volume=51&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=49&amp;au=Cowley%2C+Cortney+A%3BBrorsen%2C+B+Wade%3BHamilton%2C+Douglas+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Agricultural+and+Applied+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1816283&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Welfare Impacts of Alternative Biofuel and Energy Policies,"We employ an open economy general equilibrium model to investigate the effects of government energy policy, with an emphasis on corn-based ethanol, on the U.S. economy. The model specification incorporates world and domestic markets, assumes pollution costs from fuel consumption, and allows endogenous determination of equilibrium quantities and prices for oil, corn and ethanol. The model is calibrated to represent a recent benchmark data set for 2009 and is used to simulate the positive and normative effects of alternative policies. We find that a second best policy of a fuel tax and ethanol subsidy approximates fairly closely the welfare gains associated with the first-best policy of an optimal carbon tax and tariffs on traded goods. The largest economic gains to the U.S. economy from these energy policies arise from the impact of the policies on U.S. terms of trade, particularly in the oil market.

Applying Asset Pricing Theory to Calibrate the Price of Climate Risk,"Pricing greenhouse gas emissions is a risk management problem. It involves making trade-offs between consumption today and unknown and potentially catastrophic damages in the (distant) future. The optimal carbon price is based on society's willingness to substitute consumption across time and across uncertain states of nature. A large body of work in macroeconomics and finance has attempted to infer societal preferences using the observed behavior of asset prices, and has concluded that the standard preference specifications are inconsistent with observed asset valuations. This literature has developed a richer set of preferences that are more consistent with asset price behavior. In this paper, we explore the implications of these richer preference specifications for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), the expected discounted damage of each marginal ton of carbon emissions at an optimal emissions reductions pathway. We develop a simple discrete-time model in which the representative agent has an Epstein-Zin preference specification, and in which uncertainty about the effect of carbon emissions on global temperature and on eventual damages is gradually resolved over time. In our model the SCC is equal to the value of the carbon emissions price at any given point in time that maximizes the utility of the representative agent at that time. We embed a number of features including tail risk, the potential for technological change, and backstop technologies. When coupled with the potential for low-probability, high-impact outcomes, our calibration allows us to decompose the SCC into the expected damages and the risk-premium. In contrast to most modeled carbon price paths, our calibration suggests a high SCC today that is expected to decline over time. It also points to the importance of backstop technologies and, in contrast to standard specifications, to potentially very large deadweight costs of delay. We find, for example, that with damage distributions calibrated to an SCC of $40, a value associated with only a small risk premium, the deadweight loss in utility associated with delaying the implementation of optimal pricing by 15 years is equivalent to a 6% loss of consumption.",0,1850758636, 1605993,Working Papers,,"Daniel, Kent D;Litterman, Robert B;Wagner, Gernot"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Daniel, Kent D",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2016",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2016",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2016," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22795"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22795",w22795,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1850758636?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22795, 2016", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w22795.pdf] URL,," Financial Economics: General (G00) , Asset Pricing, Trading Volume, Bond Interest Rates (G12) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Applying+Asset+Pricing+Theory+to+Calibrate+the+Price+of+Climate+Risk&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=w22795&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Daniel%2C+Kent+D%3BLitterman%2C+Robert+B%3BWagner%2C+Gernot&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1605993&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Empirically Constrained Climate Sensitivity and the Social Cost of Carbon,"Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) require parameterization of both economic and climatic processes. The latter includes Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), or the temperature response to doubling CO2 levels, and Ocean Heat Uptake (OHU) efficiency. ECS distributions in IAMs have been drawn from climate model runs that lack an empirical basis, and in Monte Carlo experiments may not be constrained to consistent OHU values.

Empirically-Constrained Climate Sensitivity and the Social Cost of Carbon,"Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) require parameterization of both economic and climatic processes. The latter includes Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), or the temperature response to doubling CO2 levels, and Ocean Heat Uptake (OHU) efficiency. ECS distributions in IAMs have been drawn from climate model runs that lack an empirical basis,and in Monte Carlo experiments may not be constrained to consistent OHU values.

Climate Tipping and Economic Growth: Precautionary Saving and the Social Cost of Carbon,"The optimal reaction to a pending productivity shock of which the expected arrival time increases with global warming is to accumulate more precautionary capital to smooth consumption and to levy a carbon tax, proportional to the marginal hazard of a catastrophe, to curb the risk of climate change. The carbon tax holds down the stock of greenhouse gases, so that the risk of catastrophe decreases and less precautionary saving is needed. We also allow for conventional marginal climate damages and decompose the optimal carbon tax in two catastrophe components and a conventional Pigouvian component. Further, the productivity catastrophe is compared with recoverable catastrophes and with a catastrophe shock to the temperature response.

Knowledge Spillovers from Clean and Dirty Technologies,How much should governments subsidize the development of new clean technologies? We use patent citation data to investigate the relative intensity of knowledge spillovers in clean and dirty technologies in two technological fields: energy production and transportation. We introduce a new methodology that takes into account the whole history of patent citations to capture the indirect knowledge spillovers generated by patents. We find that conditional on a wide range of potential confounding factors clean patents receive on average 43% more citations than dirty patents. Knowledge spillovers from clean technologies are comparable in scale to those observed in the IT sector. The radical novelty of clean technologies relative to more incremental dirty inventions seems to account for their superiority. Our results can support public support for clean R&D. They also suggest that green policies might be able to boost economic growth through induced knowledge spillovers.,0,1566814351, 1456410,Working Papers,,"Dechezlepretre, Antoine;Martin, Ralf;Mohnen, Myra"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Dechezlepretre, Antoine",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","Centre for Economic Performance, LSE, CEP Discussion Papers, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," Centre for Economic Performance, LSE, CEP Discussion Papers"," American Economic Association  Centre for Economic Performance, LSE, CEP Discussion Papers",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1566814351?accountid=14505," Centre for Economic Performance, LSE, CEP Discussion Papers, 2014", [URL:http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1300.pdf] URL,," Innovation, Research and Development, Technological Change, Intellectual Property Rights: General (O30) , Environment and Growth (O44) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Technological Innovation (Q55) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Innovation spill-overs, Climate Change, Growth, Patents, Clean technology, Optimal climate policy",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Knowledge+Spillovers+from+Clean+and+Dirty+Technologies&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dechezlepretre%2C+Antoine%3BMartin%2C+Ralf%3BMohnen%2C+Myra&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1456410&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Inequality, Climate Impacts on the Future Poor, and Carbon Prices","Integrated assessment models of climate and the economy provide estimates of the social cost of carbon and inform climate policy. We create a variant of the Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE)--a regionally disaggregated version of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE)--in which we introduce a more fine-grained representation of economic inequalities within the model's regions. This allows us to model the common observation that climate change impacts are not evenly distributed within regions and that poorer people are more vulnerable than the rest of the population.

"Optimal Carbon Tax with a Dirty Backstop--Oil, Coal, or Renewables?","Optimal climate policy is studied. Coal, the abundant resource, contributes more CO2 per unit of energy than the exhaustible resource, oil. We characterize the optimal sequencing oil and coal and departures from the Herfindahl rule. ""Preference reversal"" can take place. If coal is very dirty compared to oil, there is no simultaneous use. Else, the optimal outcome starts with oil, before using oil and coal together, and finally coal on its own. The ""laissez-faire"" outcome uses coal forever or starts with oil until it is no longer profitable to do so and then switches to coal. The optimum requires a steeply rising CO2 tax during the oil-only phase and a less steeply rising CO2 tax during the subsequent oil-coal and coal-only phases to avoid the abrupt switch from oil to coal thus leaving a lot of oil in situ. Finally, we analyze the effects on the optimal transition times and carbon tax of a carbon-free, albeit expensive backstop (solar or wind). Without a carbon tax, a prohibitive coal tax leads to less oil in situ, substantially delays introduction of renewable, and thus curbs global warming substantially. Subsidizing renewables to just below the cost of coal does not affect the oil-only phase. The gain in green welfare dominates the welfare cost of the subsidy if the subsidy gap is small and the global warming challenge is acute.",0,859280796, 1155096,Working Papers,,"der Ploeg, Frederick van;Withagen, Cees"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," der Ploeg, Frederick van",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2011",,,, English, English,,"0, 2011","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3334, 2011", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2011," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3334"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3334",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/859280796?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3334, 2011", [URL:http://www.cesifo.de/DocCIDL/cesifo1_wp3334.pdf] URL,," Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: General (Q30) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Herfindahl rule, Hotelling rule, non-renewable resource, dirty backstop, coal, global warming, carbon tax, renewables, tax on coal, subsidy on renewables",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Carbon+Tax+with+a+Dirty+Backstop--Oil%2C+Coal%2C+or+Renewables%3F&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=der+Ploeg%2C+Frederick+van%3BWithagen%2C+Cees&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1155096&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Too Little Oil, Too Much Coal: Optimal Carbon Tax and when to Phase in Oil, Coal and Renewables","Our main message is that it is optimal to use less coal and more oil once one takes account of coal being a backstop which emits much more CO2 than oil. The way of achieving this is to have a steeply rising carbon tax during the initial oil-only phase, a less-steeply rising carbon tax during the intermediate phase where oil and coal are used alongside each other and the following coal-only phase, and a flat carbon tax during the final renewables-only phase. The ""laissez-faire"" outcome uses coal forever or starts with oil until it is no longer cost-effective to do so and then switches to coal. We also analyze the effects on the optimal transition times and carbon tax of a carbon-free, albeit expensive backstop (solar or wind energy). Subsidizing renewables to just below the cost of coal does not affect the oil-only phase. The gain in green welfare dominates the welfare cost of the subsidy if the subsidy gap is small and the global warming challenge is acute. Without a carbon tax a prohibitive coal tax leads to less oil left in situ and substantially delays introduction of renewables, but curbs global warming substantially as coal is never used.

The Safe Carbon Budget,"Cumulative emissions drive peak global warming and determine the safe carbon budget compatible with staying below 2oC or 1.5oC. The safe carbon budget is lower if uncertainty about the transient climate response is high and risk tolerance low. Together with energy costs this budget determines the constrained welfare-maximizing carbon price and how quickly fossil fuel is replaced by renewable energy and how much of it is abated. This price is the sum of a gradual damages component familiar from the unconstrained optimal carbon price highlighted in economic studies and a Hotelling component for the additional price needed to ensure that the safe carbon budget is never violated familiar from IAM studies. If policy makers ignore damages, as in the cost-minimizing temperature constraint literature, a more rapidly rising carbon price results. The alternative of adjusting damages upwards to factor in the peak warming constraint leads initially to a higher carbon price which rises less rapidly.",0,1958559833, 1667542,Working Papers,,"der Ploeg, Rick van"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," der Ploeg, Rick van",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2017",,,, English, English,,"0, 2017","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6620, 2017", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2017," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6620"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6620",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1958559833?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6620, 2017", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp6620.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , peak warming target, climate uncertainty, risk tolerance, Pigouvian damages, Hotelling rule, carbon price",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Safe+Carbon+Budget&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=der+Ploeg%2C+Rick+van&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1667542&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Integrated Assessment of Climate Catastrophes with Endogenous Uncertainty: Does the Risk of Ice Sheet Collapse Justify Precautionary Mitigation?,"Greenhouse gas policies confront the trade-off between the costs of reducing emissions and the benefits of avoided climate change. The risk of uncertain and potentially irreversible catastrophes is an important issue related to the latter, and one that has not yet been well incorporated into economic models for climate change policy analysis. This paper demonstrates a multistage stochastic programming framework for catastrophe modeling with endogenous uncertainty, applied to a benchmark integrated assessment model. This study moves beyond recent catastrophe or tipping point studies with arbitrary risk, instead investigating the specific threat of the uncertain collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), characterized in accordance with recent expert elicitations, empirical results, and physical relationships. The stochastic DICE-WAIS model introduced here informs risk management strategies that balance uncertain future climate change impacts with the costs of mitigation investments today. This work finds that accounting for the consequences of the possible WAIS collapse in a stochastic setting with endogenous uncertainty leads to more stringent climate policy recommendations (increasing the CO2 control rate by an additional 4% of global emissions and raising the social cost of carbon by $10), reflecting the need to hedge against uncertainties with downside risk as well as pursue precautionary mitigation.",0,1775622736, 1549499,Working Papers,,"Diaz, Delavane B"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Diaz, Delavane B",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2015",,,, English, English,,"0, 2015","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2015.64, 2015", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2015," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2015.64"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2015.64",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775622736?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2015.64, 2015", [URL:http://www.feem.it/userfiles/attach/201579107464NDL2015-064.pdf] URL,," Optimization Techniques, Programming Models, Dynamic Analysis (C61) , Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate Change Policy, Sea Level Rise, Ice Sheet Collapse, Endogenous Uncertainty, Stochastic Optimization, Greenhouse Gas Mitigation, Risk Management",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Integrated+Assessment+of+Climate+Catastrophes+with+Endogenous+Uncertainty%3A+Does+the+Risk+of+Ice+Sheet+Collapse+Justify+Precautionary+Mitigation%3F&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Diaz%2C+Delavane+B&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1549499&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Treatment of Risk and Uncertainty in the US Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis,"This note considers the treatment of risk and uncertainty in the recently established 'social cost of carbon' (SCC) for analysis of federal regulations in the United States. It argues that the analysis of the US Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon did not go far enough into the tail of low-probability, high-impact scenarios, and, via its approach to discounting, it mis-estimated climate risk, possibly hugely. Given the uncertainty about estimating the SCC, the note concludes by arguing that there is in fact much to commend an approach whereby a quantitative, long-term emissions target is chosen, and the price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis is then based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement to achieve that very target.",1,1462182416, 1402202,Scholarly Journals,,"Dietz, Simon",," Dietz, Simon",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2012",,1864-6042,, English, English,,"0, 2012","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2012,, American Economic Association,6,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1462182416?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 6, 2012", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL,," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate , Regulation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Treatment+of+Risk+and+Uncertainty+in+the+US+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+for+Regulatory+Impact+Analysis&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dietz%2C+Simon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1402202&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Are Economists Getting Climate Dynamics Right and Does It Matter?,"We show that several of the most important economic models of climate change produce climate dynamics inconsistent with the current crop of models in climate science. First, most economic models exhibit far too long a delay between an impulse of CO2 emissions and warming. Second, few economic models incorporate positive feedbacks in the carbon cycle, whereby carbon sinks remove less CO2 from the atmosphere, the more CO2 they have already removed cumulatively, and the higher is temperature. These inconsistencies affect economic prescriptions to abate CO2 emissions. Controlling for how the economy is represented, different climate models result in significantly different optimal CO2 emissions. A long delay between emissions and warming leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low and too much sensitivity of optimal carbon prices to the discount rate. Omitting positive carbon cycle feedbacks also leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low. We conclude it is important for policy purposes to bring economic models in line with the state of the art in climate science.",0,2386191006, 1824943,Working Papers,,"Dietz, Simon;van der Ploeg, Rick;Rezai, Armon;Venmans, Frank",," Dietz, Simon",, Working Paper,, 2020,,,, English, English,,2020,, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2020," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 8122"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 8122",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2386191006?accountid=14505,, [URL:https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp8122_0.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , carbon cycle, carbon price, climate change, integrated assessment modelling, positive feedbacks, social cost of carbon",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Are+Economists+Getting+Climate+Dynamics+Right+and+Does+It+Matter%3F&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dietz%2C+Simon%3Bvan+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick%3BRezai%2C+Armon%3BVenmans%2C+Frank&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1824943&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Relative Prices and Climate Policy: How the Scarcity of Non-Market Goods Drives Policy Evaluation,"Climate change not only impacts production and market consumption, but also the relative scarcity of non-market goods, such as environmental amenities. We study fundamental drivers of the resulting relative price changes, their potential magnitude, and their implications for climate policy in Nordhaus' prominent DICE model, thereby addressing one of its key criticisms. We propose plausible ranges for these relative prices changes based on best available evidence. Our central calibration reveals that accounting for relative prices is equivalent to decreasing pure time preference by 0.6 percentage points and leads to a more than 50 percent higher social cost of carbon.",0,2386197882, 1825013,Working Papers,,"Drupp, Moritz A;Hansel, Martin C",," Drupp, Moritz A",, Working Paper,, 2020,,,, English, English,,2020,, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2020," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 8052"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 8052",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2386197882?accountid=14505,, [URL:https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp8052.pdf] URL,," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Sustainable Development (Q01) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , climate policy, discounting, non-market goods, social cost of carbon, substitutability",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Relative+Prices+and+Climate+Policy%3A+How+the+Scarcity+of+Non-Market+Goods+Drives+Policy+Evaluation&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Drupp%2C+Moritz+A%3BHansel%2C+Martin+C&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1825013&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Disentangling the Stern/Nordhaus Controversy: Beyond the Discounting Clash,"The Stern/Nordhaus controversy has polarized the widely disparate beliefs about what to do in order to tackle the climate challenge. To explain differences in results and policy recommendations, comments following the publication of the Stern Review have mainly focused on the role played by the discount rate. A closer look at the actual drivers of the controversy reveals however that Stern and Nordhaus also disagree on two other parameters: technical progress on abatement costs and the climate sensitivity. This paper aims at appraising the relative impacts of such key drivers of the controversy on the social cost of carbon and climate policy recommendations. To this end, we use the flexible integrated assessment model RESPONSE which allows us to compare very diverse worldviews, including Stern and Nordhaus' ones within the same modelling framework and map the relative impacts of beliefs on the three key drivers of the controversy. Furthermore we appraise quantitatively, by means of a linear statistical model, the impacts on results of an extended set of core parameters of RESPONSE. We show that beliefs on long term economic growth, technical progress, the form of the climate damage function and the climate sensitivity have an impact as important as beliefs on pure time preference. Hence, we can qualify the role played by the discount rate in the Stern/Nordhaus controversy and more broadly in the definition of climate policies.",0,1125214274, 1330940,Working Papers,,"Espagne, Etienne;Perrissin Fabert, Baptiste;Pottier, Antonin;Nadaud, Franck;Patrice Dumas, Patrice Dumas"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Espagne, Etienne",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2012",,,, English, English,,"0, 2012","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.61, 2012", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2012," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.61"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.61",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1125214274?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.61, 2012", [URL:http://www.feem.it/userfiles/attach/20129121056434NDL2012-061.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Optimization Techniques, Programming Models, Dynamic Analysis (C61) , Integrated Assessment Model, Discount Rate, Social Cost of Carbon, Abatement Policy, Worldview",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Disentangling+the+Stern%2FNordhaus+Controversy%3A+Beyond+the+Discounting+Clash&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Espagne%2C+Etienne%3BPerrissin+Fabert%2C+Baptiste%3BPottier%2C+Antonin%3BNadaud%2C+Franck%3BPatrice+Dumas%2C+Patrice+Dumas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1330940&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Welfare Analysis of an Optimal Carbon Tax in Chile,"We analyze a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model which includes a negative externality that arises from fossil fuels burning. The carbon released to the atmosphere by electricity producers is the main driver of climate change. We adapt the optimal tax derived by Golosov et al. (2011) to a small open economy to force polluters to internalize their damages. The results show that the tax benefits outweigh their costs; yet welfare gains seem to be marginal under plausible parameters. We calculate the optimal carbon tax for Chile and the tax effectiveness achieved, which is around 10 percent. The results remain robust to variations in the utility function, changes in parameters that determine the externality and alternative degrees of commitment to reduce emissions.",1,1883165525, 1625461,Scholarly Journals,,"Espinosa, Cristian;Fornero, Jorge",," Espinosa, Cristian",, Journal Article,, October 2014,,0716-5927,2, English, English, 75-111,October 2014,Revista de Analisis Economico," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,29,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883165525?accountid=14505," Revista de Analisis Economico, vol. 29, no. 2, October 2014, pp. 75-111", [URL:http://www.rae-ear.org/index.php/rae/issue/archive] Publisher's URL, 75," Computable and Other Applied General Equilibrium Models (D58) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Formal and Informal Sectors, Shadow Economy, Institutional Arrangements (O17) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Chile , Latin America and the Caribbean , Climate , Equilibrium , Externality , General Equilibrium , Polluter , Tax , Tax Benefit",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Welfare+Analysis+of+an+Optimal+Carbon+Tax+in+Chile&amp;title=Revista+de+Analisis+Economico&amp;issn=07165927&amp;date=2014-10-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=75&amp;au=Espinosa%2C+Cristian%3BFornero%2C+Jorge&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Revista+de+Analisis+Economico&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1625461&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Even the Representative Agent Must Die: Using Demographics to Inform Long-Term Social Discount Rates,"We develop a demographically-based approach for estimating the utility discount rate (UDR) portion of the Ramsey rule. We show how age-specific mortality rates and life expectancies imply a natural UDR for individuals at each age in a population, and these can be aggregated into a population-level social UDR. We then provide empirical estimates for nearly all countries and for the world as a whole. A striking part of the analysis is how the estimated UDRs fall within the range of those currently employed in the macroeconomics and climate change literatures. We use our results to derive heterogenous social discount rates across countries and explore the consequences for an integrated assessment model of climate change. We find that introducing regional heterogeneity of UDRs into the RICE model has little impact on the business-as-usual trajectory of global emissions. It does, however, change the trajectory of optimal emissions, the corresponding optimal carbon tax, and the distribution of emission reductions across countries.",0,1934221902, 1652356,Working Papers,,"Fenichel, Eli P;Kotchen, Matthew J;Addicott, Ethan T"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Fenichel, Eli P",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2017",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2017",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2017," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23591"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23591",w23591,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1934221902?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23591, 2017", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w23591.pdf] URL,," Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Planning Models, Planning Policy (O21) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Even+the+Representative+Agent+Must+Die%3A+Using+Demographics+to+Inform+Long-Term+Social+Discount+Rates&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=w23591&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fenichel%2C+Eli+P%3BKotchen%2C+Matthew+J%3BAddicott%2C+Ethan+T&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1652356&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Environmental Protection for Sale: Strategic Green Industrial Policy and Climate Finance,"Industrial policy has long been criticized as subject to protectionist interests; accordingly, subsidies to domestic producers face disciplines under World Trade Organization agreements, without exceptions for environmental purposes.

Restraints on upstream subsidies erode global welfare when environmental externalities are large enough relative to political distortions.

Conflicting Goals: Energy Security vs. GHG Reductions under the EISA Cellulosic Ethanol Mandate,"Increasing energy security and lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been prominent goals in recent energy and environmental policies. While these goals are often complementary, there may also be cases where they conflict. A case in point is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The goals of EISA are to increase the United States' energy independence and security as well as to increase the production of clean renewable fuels. Title II of EISA establishes mandates for increasing the use of low carbon fuels to replace gasoline. While the Title II mandates will meet the energy security goal of EISA, the mandate for the use of at least 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol by 2022 may conflict with efforts to reduce substantially the nation's GHG emissions over the next 20 years. The nation's production capacity for biomass is likely to be limited and the use of biomass to replace coal in generating electricity yields 2 to 3 times the GHG reduction associated with using cellulosic ethanol to displace gasoline. Thus, there is a trade-off between the energy security gains of the biofuels mandate under EISA and the more effective (in terms of GHG emission reductions) use of biomass in the electric utility sector. One means of evaluating this trade-off is to examine the factors that affect the cost effectiveness of diverting biomass from electricity production to cellulosic ethanol production. This paper identifies some of the key factors that affect the cost-effectiveness of the energy security and climate change goals of EISA. The cost-effectiveness of EISA will depend on (1) constraints on biomass production, that is, the extent to which the EISA mandate may crowd out the use of biomass to generate electricity; (2) the world oil price (and the cost of production of cellulosic ethanol); and (3) the social cost of carbon.",0,56999557, 1083738,Working Papers,,"Fraas, Arthur;Johansson, Robert"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Fraas, Arthur",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2009",,,, English, English,,"0, 2009","Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers, 2009", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2009," Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers"," American Economic Association  Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56999557?accountid=14505," Resources For the Future, Discussion Papers, 2009", [URL:http://www.rff.org/documents/RFF-DP-09-24.pdf] URL,," Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Pollution Control Adoption and Costs, Distributional Effects, Employment Effects (Q52) , energy security, cost-effective policy, cellulosic ethanol",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Conflicting+Goals%3A+Energy+Security+vs.+GHG+Reductions+under+the+EISA+Cellulosic+Ethanol+Mandate&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fraas%2C+Arthur%3BJohansson%2C+Robert&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1083738&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Positively Gamma Discounting: Combining the Opinions of Experts on the Social Discount Rate,"The aggregated term structure of social discount rates that results from Weitzman's (2001) survey of expert opinion is shown to be highly sensitive to the nature of the responses. If variation reflects irreducible differences in ethical judgments, the term structure can decline rapidly. If variation occurred because respondents were forecasting future rates under uncertainty, the term structure is much flatter because additional experts provide new information. The former approach triples the social cost of carbon when compared to the latter.

Determining the Proper Scope of Climate Change Policy Benefits in U.S. Regulatory Analyses: Domestic versus Global Approaches,"Although benefit assessment principles are well established for specific populations, very little attention has been paid to how to define the scope of the pertinent population for such assessments. Whose social welfare matters and whose benefits should be included in the assessment? Should there be any linkage between the benefits and the political jurisdiction of the citizens paying for the policy? In the case of U.S. regulatory policies, the norm has been to assess the benefits to U.S. citizens. However, in 2010, the Obama administration's Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon adopted a global perspective on assessing the benefits associated with reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. This article examines whether U.S. policymakers should assess the benefits of climate change policies from a domestic or a global perspective. Drawing from executive orders and the laws governing risk and environmental regulations, we review the norms used for the scope of benefit assessments. Then we examine specific examples of the use of the global approach to benefit assessments of carbon dioxide reductions for energy efficiency regulations. We also compare the U.S. approach to that of other developed countries.

"Federal Coal Program Reform, the Clean Power Plan, and the Interaction of Upstream and Downstream Climate Policies","Coal mined on federally managed lands accounts for approximately 40% of U.S. coal consumption and 13% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions. The U.S. Department of the Interior is undertaking a programmatic review of federal coal leasing, including the climate effects of burning federal coal. This paper studies the interaction between a specific upstream policy, incorporating a carbon adder into federal coal royalties, and downstream emissions regulation under the Clean Power Plan (CPP). After providing some comparative statics, we present quantitative results from a detailed dynamic model of the power sector, the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). The IPM analysis indicates that, in the absence of the CPP, a royalty adder equal to the social cost of carbon could reduce emissions by roughly 3/4 of the emissions reduction that the CPP is projected to achieve. If instead the CPP is binding, the royalty adder would: reduce the price of tradeable emissions allowances, produce some additional emissions reductions by reducing leakage, and reduce wholesale power prices under a mass-based CPP but increase them under a rate-based CPP. A federal royalty adder increases mining of non-federal coal, but this substitution is limited by a shift to electricity generation by gas and renewables.",0,1792759670, 1570307,Working Papers,,"Gerarden, Todd;Reeder, W Spencer;Stock, James H"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Gerarden, Todd",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2016",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2016",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2016," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22214"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22214",w22214,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1792759670?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22214, 2016", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w22214.pdf] URL,," Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Federal+Coal+Program+Reform%2C+the+Clean+Power+Plan%2C+and+the+Interaction+of+Upstream+and+Downstream+Climate+Policies&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=w22214&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gerarden%2C+Todd%3BReeder%2C+W+Spencer%3BStock%2C+James+H&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1570307&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
A Rapid Assessment Model for Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon: Calculating the Social Costs of Carbon without Knowing Preferences,"The Social Costs of Carbon (SCC) equals the marginal welfare loss associated with one unit of emitted CO2, divided by the marginal welfare gain associated with one unit of consumption. In stochastic assessments, both the nominator and denominator can depend on uncertain parameters; specifically they depend on the (implicit) scaling of the welfare function with the parameters. I discuss some pitfalls when calculating the expected value or the certainty equivalent of the SCC, and show that a mistaken procedure easily leads to very high or very low estimates for the SCC.

Global Demographic Change and Climate Policies,"Between 1950 and 2017, world average life expectancy increased from below-50 to above-70, while the fertility rate dropped from 5 to about 2.5. We develop and calibrate an analytic climate-economy model with overlapping generations to study the effect of such demographic change on capital markets and optimal climate policies. Our model replicates findings from the OLG-demography literature, such as a rise in households' savings, and a declining rate of return to capital. We also find that demographic change raises the social cost of carbon, at 2020, from 28 euro/tCO2 in a model that abstracts from demography, to 94 euro/tCO2 in our calibrated model.",0,1958566711, 1667545,Working Papers,,"Gerlagh, Reyer;Jaimes, Richard;Motavasseli, Ali"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Gerlagh, Reyer",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2017",,,, English, English,,"0, 2017","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6617, 2017", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2017," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6617"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6617",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1958566711?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6617, 2017", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp6617.pdf] URL,," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Demographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts (J11) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , climate change, social cost of carbon, environmental policy, demographic trends",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Global+Demographic+Change+and+Climate+Policies&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gerlagh%2C+Reyer%3BJaimes%2C+Richard%3BMotavasseli%2C+Ali&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1667545&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Carbon Prices for the Next Hundred Years,"World income grows fast without verifiable climate-change impacts on the economy. The growth spell can end if climate impacts turn real but this can take decades to learn. We develop a tractable stochastic climate-economy model with a hidden-state impact process to evaluate the contributions of the expanding economy and changing impact beliefs to the social cost of carbon. Taking a dataset of estimates for the social cost as a representation of beliefs, we assess how robust climate policies are to the delays of hard information. The carbon price should rise with income to the next century, even without observed impacts. The carbon price should grow faster than the economy as long as climate warming is not enough for generating impacts that are informative about the true social cost.",1,1531422541, 1438899,Working Papers,,"Gerlagh, Reyer;Liski, Matti"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Gerlagh, Reyer",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4671, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4671"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4671",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1531422541?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4671, 2014", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2014/wp-cesifo-2014-02/cesifo1_wp4671. pdf] URL,," Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Public Goods (H41) , Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Intertemporal Household Choice, Life Cycle Models and Saving (D15) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Macroeconomics: Consumption, Saving, Wealth (E21) , carbon price, learning, climate change",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Carbon+Prices+for+the+Next+Hundred+Years&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gerlagh%2C+Reyer%3BLiski%2C+Matti&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1438899&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Our analysis overcomes the absence of vital registration systems in many poor countries, which has been a limiting factor in the temperature-mortality literature, by extracting birth histories from household surveys. Studying 53 developing countries that span the globe, we find impacts of hot days on infant mortality that are an order of magnitude larger than estimates from rich country studies, with humidity playing an important role.

Optimal Taxes on Fossil Fuel in General Equilibrium,"We analyze a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium (DSGE) model with an externality--through climate change--from using fossil energy. Our central result is a simple formula for the marginal externality damage of emissions (or, equivalently, for the optimal carbon tax). This formula, which holds under quite plausible assumptions, reveals that the damage is proportional to current GDP, with the proportion depending only on three factors: (i) discounting, (ii) the expected damage elasticity (how many percent of the output flow is lost from an extra unit of carbon in the atmosphere), and (iii) the structure of carbon depreciation in the atmosphere. Thus, the stochastic values of future output, consumption, and the atmospheric CO2 concentration, as well as the paths of technology (whether endogenous or exogenous) and population, and so on, all disappear from the formula. We find that the optimal tax should be a bit higher than the median, or most well-known, estimates in the literature. We also formulate a parsimonious yet comprehensive and easily solved model allowing us to compute the optimal and market paths for the use of different sources of energy and the corresponding climate change. We find coal--rather than oil--to be the main threat to economic welfare, largely due to its abundance. We also find that the costs of inaction are particularly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the substitutability of different energy sources and technological progress.",1,1520323829, 1428866,Scholarly Journals,,"Golosov, Mikhail;Hassler, John;Krusell, Per;Tsyvinski, Aleh",," Golosov, Mikhail",, Journal Article, 1468-0262, January 2014,,0012-9682,1, English, English, 41-88,January 2014,Econometrica," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,82,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1520323829?accountid=14505," Econometrica, vol. 82, no. 1, January 2014, pp. 41-88", [URL:http://www.econometricsociety.org/tocs.asp] Publisher's URL, 41," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels (L71) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q31) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Endogenous , Energy , Energy Sources , Externality , Fuel , Oil , Tax , Taxes",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Taxes+on+Fossil+Fuel+in+General+Equilibrium&amp;title=Econometrica&amp;issn=00129682&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=82&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=41&amp;au=Golosov%2C+Mikhail%3BHassler%2C+John%3BKrusell%2C+Per%3BTsyvinski%2C+Aleh&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Econometrica&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1428866&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Increase in Risk and Its Effects on Welfare and Optimal Policies in a Dynamic Setting: The Case of Global Pollution,"This paper studies the effects of an increase in risk on welfare and optimal policies in a stochastic dynamic model of global pollution. In the first step, we focus on the case of a single decision maker, and make use of an approach pioneered by Kimball (2014) for studying the impact of a marginal change in risk in optimal stochastic control models. Using a simple model with only one state variable and one control variable, we show how the optimal carbon tax responds to an increase in risk. It is found that the third derivative of the decay function of the stock of pollution may play a decisive role. In a second step, we investigate the extent to which Kimball's approach may be extended to the case of stochastic dynamic games. We show how strategic interactions complicate the task of evaluating the effects of an increase in risk. Interestingly, in a dynamic model of the tragedy of the commons, we find that an increase in risk can increase welfare even though all agents are risk averse. The reason is that higher risk can cause agents to be more conservative, and this mitigates the tragedy of the commons.",1,1700656788, 1505506,Scholarly Journals,,"Grafton, Quentin;Kompas, Tom;Van Long, Ngo",," Grafton, Quentin",, Journal Article, 1554-9658, March 2014,,1554-964X,1, English, English, 40-64,March 2014,Geneva Risk and Insurance Review," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,39,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1700656788?accountid=14505," Geneva Risk and Insurance Review, vol. 39, no. 1, March 2014, pp. 40-64", [URL:https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10713] Publisher's URL, 40," Stochastic and Dynamic Games, Evolutionary Games, Repeated Games (C73) , Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Dynamic Games , Games , Pollution , Risk , Risk Averse , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Increase+in+Risk+and+Its+Effects+on+Welfare+and+Optimal+Policies+in+a+Dynamic+Setting%3A+The+Case+of+Global+Pollution&amp;title=Geneva+Risk+and+Insurance+Review&amp;issn=1554964X&amp;date=2014-03-01&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=40&amp;au=Grafton%2C+Quentin%3BKompas%2C+Tom%3BVan+Long%2C+Ngo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Geneva+Risk+and+Insurance+Review&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1505506&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Sequestration du carbone et politique climatique optimale. (Carbon Sequestration and Optimal Climate Policy. With English summary.),"We present an endogenous growth model in which the use of a non-renewable natural resource generates carbon-dioxide emissions that can be partly sequestered. This approach breaks with the systematic link between resource use and pollution emission. The accumulated stock of remaining emissions has a negative impact on household utility and corporate productivity. While sequestration quickens the optimal extraction rate, it can also generate higher emissions in the short run. It also has an adverse effect on economic growth. We study the impact of a carbon tax: the level of the tax has an effect in our model, its optimal level is positive, and it can be interpreted ex post as a decreasing ad valorem tax on the resource.",0,742852070, 1106659,Scholarly Journals,,"Grimaud, Andre;Rouge, Luc",," Grimaud, Andre",, Journal Article, 1777-5795,"  0, 2009",,0249-4744,190-191, French, French, 53-69,"0, 2009",Economie et Prevision," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2009,, American Economic Association,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/742852070?accountid=14505," Economie et Prevision, no. 190-191, 2009, pp. 53-69", [URL:http://www.cairn.info/revue-economie-et-prevision.htm] Publisher's URL, 53," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , One, Two, and Multisector Growth Models (O41) , Energy and the Macroeconomy (Q43) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate , Economic Growth , Growth , Natural Resource , Pollution , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Sequestration+du+carbone+et+politique+climatique+optimale.+%28Carbon+Sequestration+and+Optimal+Climate+Policy.+With+English+summary.%29&amp;title=Economie+et+Prevision&amp;issn=02494744&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=190-191&amp;spage=53&amp;au=Grimaud%2C+Andre%3BRouge%2C+Luc&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economie+et+Prevision&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1106659&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Social Time Preference and the Optimal Carbon Price,"This article examines the implications of alternative social time preference assumptions for the optimal carbon price by numerical simulations of a simple Ramsey model. Three specifications of social time preferences are compared: a constant social time preference rate (STPR), decreasing social impatience or hyperbolic social preferences and increasing social impatience.

"Global Demographic Change, Carbon Emissions, the Optimal Carbon Price and Carbon Abatement","This paper empirically analyses the prospective impact of global demographic change on the time path of the optimal carbon price, global emissions and global carbon abatement. The approach is to apply a simple Ramsey model in order to examine the effect of global demographic change on the fundamental drivers of the optimal carbon price and optimal abatement. The results suggest a policy trade-off to some extent between mitigating population ageing and mitigating climate change. The lower fertility scenario, which implies an older future population, results in lower carbon emissions and therefore a lower optimal carbon price. Policies to mitigate population ageing would therefore increase carbon emissions and increase the carbon price.",1,753925146, 1119259,Scholarly Journals,,"Guest, Ross",," Guest, Ross",, Journal Article, 1524-5861,"  0, 2010",,2194-5659,2, English, English,,"0, 2010",Global Economy Journal," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2010,, American Economic Association,10,https://search.proquest.com/docview/753925146?accountid=14505," Global Economy Journal, vol. 10, no. 2, 2010", [URL:http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/gej] Publisher's URL,," Demographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts (J11) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Demographics , Population",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Global+Demographic+Change%2C+Carbon+Emissions%2C+the+Optimal+Carbon+Price+and+Carbon+Abatement&amp;title=Global+Economy+Journal&amp;issn=21945659&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=&amp;au=Guest%2C+Ross&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Global+Economy+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1119259&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Externalities in Risky Resource Markets--Optimal Taxes, Leakage and Divestment","We consider a global externality of resource use, with the example of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. A region concerned about climate change may reduce its fuel deposit offer, reduce fuel consumption, and withdraw investments into global fuel extraction. We study leakage rates and optimal taxes on these three activities in a framework with uncertain fuel market returns. Without uncertainty, the unilateral investment tax is welfare-neutral: costless but ineffective divestment. With uncertainty, the regional investment choice affects global fuel usage, and correspondingly the optimal regional fuel policy contains a investment tax in addition to taxes on deposit supply and consumption. Even absent terms-of-trade effects, the optimal unilateral investment tax is a non-marginal fraction of the perceived climate disutility for a region of any size. Equivalently, a rational portfolio optimizer with relevant concern for the climate problem withdraws parts or all of her funds from the carbon sector.",0,1792761144, 1568992,Working Papers,,"Habermacher, Florian"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Habermacher, Florian",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2016",,,, English, English,,"0, 2016","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5865, 2016", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2016," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5865"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5865",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1792761144?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5865, 2016", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2016/wp-cesifo-2016-04/cesifo1_wp5865. pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , unilateral climate policy, optimal carbon tax, investment uncertainty, carbon leakage, resource rent tax, fossil fuel market, carbon divestment, fuel investment tax, desposit supply tax, exhaustible resources",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Externalities+in+Risky+Resource+Markets--Optimal+Taxes%2C+Leakage+and+Divestment&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Habermacher%2C+Florian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1568992&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Supply- versus Demand-Side Policies in the Presence of Carbon Leakage and the Green Paradox,"We consider a climate coalition that seeks to reduce global emissions in the presence of carbon leakage and resource exhaustibility. We show that a credible announcement of future unilateral supply-side policies delays foreign emissions, and we derive the optimal combination of consumer taxes and producer taxes when we consider leakages from free riders, both within periods and across periods. The tax shares generally differ over time. A decline in the present value of the social cost of carbon over time supports a time path where the consumers' tax share of the total carbon tax also declines over time.

The Carbon Abatement Game,"Climate change is considered as one of the major global challenges. Although countries past and future contributions to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are different, all countries are affected, but not necessarily in the same way (e.g. rising sea levels). This is the reason why it is so hard to reach global agreements on this matter. We study this issue in a dynamic game-theoretical model (stochastic differential game) with multiple countries that are open economies, i.e. we allow for international trade between the countries. Our framework involves stochastic dynamics for CO2-emissions and economic output of the countries. Each country is represented by a recursive-preference functional. Despite its complexity, the model is tractable and we can quantify each country's decision on consumption, investment, carbon abatement and the social cost of carbon, explicitly. One key finding is that both the country-specific and global social cost of carbon are increasing in the trade volume. This result is robust to adding capital transfers between countries. Our numerical examples suggest that disregarding trade might lead to a significant underestimation of the SCC.",0,2064750579, 1711134,Working Papers,,"Hambel, Christoph;Kraft, Holger;Schwartz, Eduardo S"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Hambel, Christoph",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2018",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2018",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2018," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 24604"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 24604",w24604,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2064750579?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 24604, 2018", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w24604.pdf] URL,," Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Carbon+Abatement+Game&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=w24604&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hambel%2C+Christoph%3BKraft%2C+Holger%3BSchwartz%2C+Eduardo+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1711134&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Economic analysis of projects in a greenhouse world,"Recent carbon market prices are substantially lower than mean or median estimates of the social cost of carbon in the literature. Intuition would therefore suggest that 'investment errors' are being made, in the sense that markets favor higher carbon-emitting projects, while global welfare would be larger with lower carbon-emitting projects. This intuition is correct in specific circumstances, but not others. For any comparison of two alternative projects, there is a carbon switching price that equalizes their net social benefits. From the perspective of maximizing global welfare, investment errors only occur when this switching price lies between the carbon market price and the social cost of carbon. Data on the costs of high-carbon and low-carbon electric generation projects suggest that there is no financing gap using mean or median published figures, but for precautionary (95th percentile) choices of the social cost of carbon, there is a financing gap between carbon market prices and the switching price that would trigger investment in the global welfare-maximizing low-carbon project. A global carbon fund to finance this gap could be conceived, but stricter emission caps and reforms of carbon markets are likely to be a more efficient solution to the problem.",0,1125223482, 1332375,Working Papers,,"Hamilton, Kirk;Stover, Jana"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Hamilton, Kirk",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2012",,,, English, English,,"0, 2012","The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6117, 2012", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2012," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6117"," American Economic Association  The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6117",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1125223482?accountid=14505," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6117, 2012", [URL:http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/07/02/000158349_20120702160519/Rendered/PDF/WPS6117.pdf] URL,,,https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Economic+analysis+of+projects+in+a+greenhouse+world&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hamilton%2C+Kirk%3BStover%2C+Jana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1332375&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Agreeing to Disagree on Climate Policy,"Disagreements about the value of the utility discount rate--the rate at which our concern for the welfare of future people declines with their distance from us in time--are at the heart of the debate about the appropriate intensity of climate policy. Seemingly small differences in the discount rate yield very different policy prescriptions, and no consensus ""correct"" value has been identified. We argue that the choice of discount rate is an ethical primitive: there are many different legitimate opinions as to its value, and none should receive a privileged place in the economic analysis of climate policy. Rather, we advocate a social choice-based approach in which a diverse set of individual discount rates is aggregated into a ""representative"" rate. We show that performing this aggregation efficiently leads to a time-dependent discount rate that declines monotonically to the lowest rate in the population. We apply this discounting scheme to calculations of the social cost of carbon recently performed by the US government and show that it provides an attractive compromise between competing ethical positions, and thus provides a possible resolution to the ethical impasse in climate change economics.",1,1983780459, 1675938,Scholarly Journals,,"Heal, Geoffrey M;Millner, Antony",," Heal, Geoffrey M",, Journal Article, 1091-6490, March 2014,,0027-8424,10, English, English, 3695-3698,March 2014,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,111,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1983780459?accountid=14505," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 111, no. 10, March 2014, pp. 3695-98", [URL:http://www.pnas.org/content/by/section/Economic%20Sciences] Publisher's URL, 3695," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Agreeing+to+Disagree+on+Climate+Policy&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&amp;issn=00278424&amp;date=2014-03-01&amp;volume=111&amp;issue=10&amp;spage=3695&amp;au=Heal%2C+Geoffrey+M%3BMillner%2C+Antony&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1675938&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Assessment: Climate-Change Policy,"The paper provides a guide to climate-change policy, and, in particular, the three core components: targets, instruments, and institutional structures. First, the optimal path for reducing carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions, and the role of the social cost of carbon in the estimation and revision of the path are set out.

Climate Tipping Points and Solar Geoengineering,"We study optimal climate policy when climate tipping points and solar geoengineering are present. Solar geoengineering reduces temperatures without reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate tipping points are irreversible and uncertain events that cause large damages. We analyze three different rules related to the availability of solar geoengineering: a ban, using solar geoengineering as insurance against the risk of tipping points, or using solar geoengineering only as remediation in the aftermath of a tipping point. We model three distinct types of tipping points: two that alter the climate system and one that yields a direct economic cost. Using an analytic model, we find that an optimal policy, which minimizes expected losses from the tipping point, includes both emissions reductions and solar geoengineering from the onset. Using a numerical simulation model, we quantify optimal policy and various outcomes under the alternative scenarios. The presence of tipping points leads to more mitigation and more solar geoengineering use and lower temperatures.",1,1737998072, 1531525,Working Papers,,"Heutel, Garth;Cruz, Juan Moreno;Shayegh, Soheil"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Heutel, Garth",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2015",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2015",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2015," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 21589"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 21589",w21589,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1737998072?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 21589, 2015", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w21589.pdf] URL,," Optimization Techniques, Programming Models, Dynamic Analysis (C61) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Tipping+Points+and+Solar+Geoengineering&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=w21589&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heutel%2C+Garth%3BCruz%2C+Juan+Moreno%3BShayegh%2C+Soheil&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1531525&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Use of a Social Cost of Carbon in Canadian Cost-Benefit Analysis,"The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is being adopted for systematic use in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) conducted by the Government of Canada. Although there are potential efficiency gains from its application, we argue that the SCC may be inappropriate for use in CBA for three reasons. First, as currently calculated, the SCC typically excludes the potential for catastrophes and certain types of climate damages, and assumes perfect substitutability between natural and human capital. For these reasons, it is likely to be biased downwards, and as such would provide misleading advice to policy-makers. Second, the SCC is a global measure of benefits, whereas standard practice in CBA is to include only domestic costs and benefits. Accounting for costs borne outside of Canada and along only one dimension (carbon damage) risks reducing economic efficiency and confusing the users of CBA studies. Third, SCC-based decision-making is unlikely to be consistent with Canadian commitments to international partners on emissions reductions; so its adoption risks institutionalizing non-delivery of those commitments.",1,1462179137, 1401620,Scholarly Journals,,"Heyes, Anthony;Morgan, Dylan;Rivers, Nicholas",," Heyes, Anthony",, Journal Article, 1911-9917, August 2013,,0317-0861,, English, English, S67-S79,August 2013,Canadian Public Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,39,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1462179137?accountid=14505," Canadian Public Policy, vol. 39, Supplement 2 August 2013, pp. S67-79", [URL:http://www.utpjournals.press/loi/cpp] Publisher's URL, S67," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Canada , Northern America , Climate , Cost Benefit , Efficiency",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Use+of+a+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+in+Canadian+Cost-Benefit+Analysis&amp;title=Canadian+Public+Policy&amp;issn=03170861&amp;date=2013-08-01&amp;volume=39&amp;issue=&amp;spage=S67&amp;au=Heyes%2C+Anthony%3BMorgan%2C+Dylan%3BRivers%2C+Nicholas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Canadian+Public+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1401620&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Energy Costs of Historic Preservation,"We explore the impact of historic preservation policies on domestic energy consumption. Using panel data for England from 2006 to 2013 and employing a fixed effects strategy, we document that (i) rising national energy prices induce an increase in home energy efficiency installations and a corresponding reduction in energy consumption and (ii) this energy saving effect is significantly less pronounced in Conservation Areas and in places with high concentrations of Listed Buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency installations is typically more costly and sometimes legally prevented altogether. Historic preservation policies increase private energy costs and the social cost of carbon per designated dwelling by around 11,600 GBP (19,100 USD) and 2,400 GBP (4,000 USD), respectively. These costs ought to be weighed against any benefits of preservation.",1,2350311567, 1812168,Scholarly Journals," London School of Economics and Political Science , London School of Economics and Political Science , CEP, London School of Economics and Political Science and City, U of London","Hilber, Christian A L;Palmer, Charles;Pinchbeck, Edward W",," Hilber, Christian A L",, Journal Article,, November 2019,,0094-1190,, English, English,,November 2019,Journal of Urban Economics, CSAPTjournals,2019,, American Economic Association,114,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2350311567?accountid=14505," Journal of Urban Economics, vol. 114", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00941190] Publisher's URL,," Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Production Analysis and Firm Location: Government Policy (R38) , U.K. , Europe , Energy , Energy Efficiency",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Energy+Costs+of+Historic+Preservation&amp;title=Journal+of+Urban+Economics&amp;issn=00941190&amp;date=2019-11-01&amp;volume=114&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hilber%2C+Christian+A+L%3BPalmer%2C+Charles%3BPinchbeck%2C+Edward+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Urban+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1812168&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Faustmann and the Climate,This paper presents an adjusted Faustmann Rule for optimal harvest of a forest in the presence of a social cost of carbon emissions. A contribution of the paper is to do this within theoretical and numerical frameworks that take account of the dynamics and interactions of the forest's multiple carbon pools within an infinite time horizon model. With our less restrictive assumptions we find that a social cost of carbon has a significantly stronger effect on the optimal harvest age than found in earlier studies. Considered is also how increased use of harvest residues for energy purposes and storage of carbon in building materials and furniture should influence the length of the rotation period. The theoretical results are quantified within a numerical framework.,1,1125210001, 1330234,Working Papers,,"Hoel, Michael;Holtsmark, Bjart;Holtsmark, Katinka"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Hoel, Michael",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2012",,,, English, English,,"0, 2012","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3951, 2012", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2012," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3951"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3951",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1125210001?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 3951, 2012", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2012/wp-cesifo-2012-10/cesifo1_wp3951. pdf] URL,," Renewable Resources and Conservation: Forestry (Q23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , climate, forestry, biofuels, Faustmann, carbon",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Faustmann+and+the+Climate&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hoel%2C+Michael%3BHoltsmark%2C+Bjart%3BHoltsmark%2C+Katinka&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1330234&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Wood-Based Bioenergy,"During recent years increased attention has been given to second-generation wood-based bioenergy. The carbon stored in the forest is highest when there is little or no harvest from the forest. Increasing the harvest from a forest, in order to produce more bioenergy, may thus conflict with the direct benefit of the forest as a carbon sink. We analyze this conflict using a simple model where bioenergy and fossil energy are perfect substitutes. Our analysis shows how the social optimum will depend on the social cost of carbon, and how the social optimum may be obtained by suitable taxes and subsidies.",0,1531424242, 1438884,Working Papers,,"Hoel, Michael;Sletten, Thea Marcelia"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Hoel, Michael",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4686, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4686"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4686",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1531424242?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4686, 2014", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2014/wp-cesifo-2014-03/cesifo1_wp4686. pdf] URL,," Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: General (Q30) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , climate, carbon, bioenergy",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Wood-Based+Bioenergy&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hoel%2C+Michael%3BSletten%2C+Thea+Marcelia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1438884&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Environmental Benefits from Transportation Electrification: Urban Buses,"We determine the environmental benefit of using electric buses rather than diesel or CNG for urban transit. For diesel and CNG we calculate air pollution damages by combining emission rates with damage valuations from the AP3 integrated assessment model and the social cost of carbon. For electric buses we calculate air pollution damages by combining the damage valuations with estimates of the marginal increase in emissions from electricity usage. The environmental benefit is positive on average across all counties in the contiguous U.S. when comparing electric to either diesel or CNG. The environmental benefit of operating an electric bus fleet (rather than diesel) is about $65 million per year in Los Angeles and above $10 million per year in six other MSAs. Including the environmental benefit, we calculate the net present value (NPV) of bus investment. Relative to diesel, the NPV benefit of an electric bus is positive in about two thirds of urban counties. Relative to CNG, the NPV benefit is negative in all counties.",0,2412516520, 1838033,Working Papers,,"Holland, Stephen P;Mansur, Erin T;Muller, Nicholas Z;Yates, Andrew J",," Holland, Stephen P",, Working Paper,, 2020,,,, English, English,,2020,, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2020," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 27285"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 27285",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2412516520?accountid=14505,, [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w27285.pdf] URL,," Externalities (D62) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Transportation Economics: General (R40)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Environmental+Benefits+from+Transportation+Electrification%3A+Urban+Buses&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holland%2C+Stephen+P%3BMansur%2C+Erin+T%3BMuller%2C+Nicholas+Z%3BYates%2C+Andrew+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1838033&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Commentary: The Social Cost of Carbon: What Does It Actually Depend On?,"The social cost of carbon (SCC) is the value of the climate change impacts from 1 tonne of carbon emitted today as CO2, aggregated over time and discounted back to the present day. We used PAGE2002, the same probabilistic integrated assessment model as used by the Stern Review (Stern et al., 2006), to calculate the SCC and to examine how it varies with discount rate; and find that it is not sensitive to the path of emissions on which the tonne of carbon is superimposed. The mean value of the SCC is $43 per tonne under both a business-as-usual scenario, and under a scenario aimed at stabilizing CO2 concentrations at 550 ppm. This counter-intuitive result is caused by the interplay between the logarithmic relationship between forcing and concentration, the nonlinear relationship of damage to temperature, and discounting. However, the SCC is sensitive to a number of scientific and economic inputs to the model. Two recent distributions for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 (Murphy et al., 2004; Stainforth et al., 2005) increase the mean value of the SCC from $43 to $68 and $90 per tonne. Using a pure rate of time preference of 0.1% per year, as in the Stern Review, gives a mean SCC of $365 per tonne.",0,56646221, 0922290,Scholarly Journals,,"Hope, Chris W",," Hope, Chris W",, Journal Article, 1752-7457,"  0, 2006",,1469-3062,5, English, English, 565-572,"0, 2006",Climate Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2006,, American Economic Association,6,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56646221?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 6, no. 5, 2006, pp. 565-72", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, 565," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Global , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Commentary%3A+The+Social+Cost+of+Carbon%3A+What+Does+It+Actually+Depend+On%3F&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=565&amp;au=Hope%2C+Chris+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0922290&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Calculating The Social Cost Of Carbon,"The paper1 discusses the determination of the social cost of carbon (SCC) using the PAGE2002 model used in the Stern Review. The SCC depends sensitively on assumptions about future economic development, the range and likelihood of economic and social damage arising from climate change at future dates and the discount rate to apply to that damage. The paper critically examines the choice of pure time preference and the weight to place on damage experienced by other countries in the distant future. Key conclusions are that the SCC rises at about 2.4% p.a. and the range of plausible estimates for the SCC is wide. The SCC is sensitive to a number of factors, significantly the equilibrium temperature rise for a doubling of CO2 concentration, the pure rate of time preference, the non-economic impact, the inequality weighting parameter and the half-life of global warming. Within the model the SCC appears surprisingly insensitive to the emissions scenario for reasons that are explained. The paper points out that methane and SF6 are also powerful GHGs whose impact can be estimated within the model.",0,56607266, 0945762,Working Papers,,"Hope, Chris;Newbery, David"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Hope, Chris",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2006",,,, English, English, 24,"0, 2006","Faculty of Economics (formerly DAE), University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics, 2006, 24 pp.", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2006," Faculty of Economics (formerly DAE), University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics"," American Economic Association  Faculty of Economics (formerly DAE), University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56607266?accountid=14505," Faculty of Economics (formerly DAE), University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics, 2006, 24 pp.", [URL:http://www.electricitypolicy.org.uk/pubs/wp/eprg0720.pdf] URL, 24," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Pollution Control Adoption and Costs, Distributional Effects, Employment Effects (Q52) , Climate change, social impacts, carbon price, rate of pure time preference.",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Calculating+The+Social+Cost+Of+Carbon&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=24&amp;au=Hope%2C+Chris%3BNewbery%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0945762&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Triggering the Low-Carbon Transition in the Aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis,"An assessment of the post-Kyoto climate change negotiations, and the altered role of climate finance post-financial crisis, is presented. First, the paradigm shift of the Cancun Agreements is examined from an historical perspective and it is shown that the impasse in the negotiations, caused by the underlying over-emphasis on burden sharing reductions in emissions, can be overcome. Second, using information from two modelling exercises, it is demonstrated how climate finance can encourage the decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and thereby help align the development pattern with global climate goals. Third, a framework to place carbon finance within current discussions is sketched regarding both the reformation of the world financial systems and the facilitation of a sustainable economic recovery that is beneficial for North and South while addressing the low-carbon transition. It is concluded that upgrading climate finance is the key to triggering the shift to a low-carbon society and a system is proposed in which an agreed social cost of carbon is used to support the establishment of carbon emissions certificates to reorient a significant portion of global savings towards low-carbon investments. Policy relevance--Investments that align development and climate objectives are shown to substantially lower the social cost of carbon and deliver long-term carbon emissions reductions. These reductions are greater than those contributed by the sole carbon price signal generated by a world cap-and-trade system. Carbon finance, as a part of the broader reform of financial systems and overseas aid, can help overcome the dual adversity of climate and financial crisis contexts. The carbon certificate, with an upfront agreed social cost of carbon, can be used as its instrument. The portion of the banking system that intends to reorient a significant part of world savings towards low-carbon investments could thus issue such carbon certificates. By giving carbon assets the status of a reserve currency, the system could even respond to the need of emerging countries to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and trigger a wave of worldwide sustainable growth through infrastructure markets.",1,1761436279, 1538923,Scholarly Journals,,"Hourcade, Jean-Charles;Shukla, Priyadarshi",," Hourcade, Jean-Charles",, Journal Article, 1752-7457,"  0, 2013",,1469-3062,, English, English, S22-S35,"0, 2013",Climate Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,13,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1761436279?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 13, Supplement 1 2013, pp. S22-35", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, S22," International Monetary Arrangements and Institutions (F33) , International Financial Policy: Financial Transactions Tax, Capital Controls (F38) , Financial Crises (G01) , Sustainable Development (Q01) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , Climate , Currency , Finance , Financial Crisis , Foreign Exchange , Trade",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Triggering+the+Low-Carbon+Transition+in+the+Aftermath+of+the+Global+Financial+Crisis&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=&amp;spage=S22&amp;au=Hourcade%2C+Jean-Charles%3BShukla%2C+Priyadarshi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1538923&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Carbon Taxation When Climate Affects Productivity,"Based on a model where climate change affects productivity, the second-best optimal carbon tax is found to exceed marginal social damage by 53% and ""marginal private damage"" (aggregate households' willingness to pay) by 73%. Annual welfare gains are estimated at $3.58 billion when marginal damage is $40 per ton; employment also increases. A carbon tax set at the Pigouvian rate raises welfare by only $3.17 billion.

Global Food Demand and Carbon-Preserving Cropland Expansion under Varying Levels of Intensification,"Increasing demand for agricultural crops and a decline in the rate of yield improvements will require expansion of cropland (extensification), resulting in a loss of carbon storage. This paper uses global, spatially explicit data to analyze how extensification can be located to meet crop demand in a way that minimizes carbon losses under varying levels of intensification. Carbon-preserving extensification can reduce carbon loss by 7.3 billion tons compared to proportionally increasing extensification by 2050, valued at $1.3 trillion (2012 dollars) based on an estimated social cost of carbon of $181 per ton of carbon (~$50 per ton CO2).",1,1850758133, 1609995,Scholarly Journals,,"Johnson, Justin Andrew;Runge, Carlisle Ford;Senauer, Benjamin;Polasky, Stephen",," Johnson, Justin Andrew",, Journal Article, 1543-8325, November 2016,,0023-7639,4, English, English, 579-592,November 2016,Land Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,92,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1850758133?accountid=14505," Land Economics, vol. 92, no. 4, November 2016, pp. 579-92", [URL:http://le.uwpress.org/content/by/year] Publisher's URL, 579," Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Agriculture: Aggregate Supply and Demand Analysis, Prices (Q11) , Land Ownership and Tenure, Land Reform, Land Use, Irrigation, Agriculture and Environment (Q15) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Land Use Patterns (R14) , Global , Cropland , Food , Spatially",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Global+Food+Demand+and+Carbon-Preserving+Cropland+Expansion+under+Varying+Levels+of+Intensification&amp;title=Land+Economics&amp;issn=00237639&amp;date=2016-11-01&amp;volume=92&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=579&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Justin+Andrew%3BRunge%2C+Carlisle+Ford%3BSenauer%2C+Benjamin%3BPolasky%2C+Stephen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Land+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1609995&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Battle for Climate and Scarcity Rents: Beyond the Linear-Quadratic Case,"The nature of oil demand influences the oil extraction rate and hence has implications for both the timing of oil exhaustion and optimal climate policy. We analyse what role oil demand specification plays in strategic interactions b between an oil-importing country producing final goods and wishing to mitigate global warming (Industria) and an oil-exporting country (Oilrabia) who buys final goods from the other country. Industria uses the carbon tax to impose an import tariff on oil and steal some of Oilrabia's scarcity rent. We derive subgame-perfect and open-loop Nash equilibrium outcomes and obtain results about the relative speeds of oil extraction and carbon accumulation and compare these with the efficient and competitive outcomes. We show that for the most typical demand functions, open-loop oil price will always be initially higher resulting in delayed extraction. However, we demonstrate that for certain more complex demand specification, Oilrabia has an incentive to initially price oil lower than the efficient level, resulting in more oil extraction and more climate damages. We further show that using the carbon tax as a tariff may not be as beneficial as suggested by previous studies. For certain demand functions, Industria sets the tariff too high leading to a decrease in the consumers welfare that isn't compensated by the higher tariff revenues.",1,1629322119, 1465582,Working Papers,,"Kagan, Mark;Van der Ploeg, Rick;Withagen, Cees A"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Kagan, Mark",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5041, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5041"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5041",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1629322119?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5041, 2014", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2014/wp-cesifo-2014-10/cesifo1_wp5041. pdf] URL,," Stochastic and Dynamic Games, Evolutionary Games, Repeated Games (C73) , Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents: General (H30) , Exhaustible Resources and Economic Development (Q32) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Issues in International Trade (Q37) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , exhaustible resources, Hotelling rule, efficiency, carbon tax, climate rent, differential game, subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Battle+for+Climate+and+Scarcity+Rents%3A+Beyond+the+Linear-Quadratic+Case&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kagan%2C+Mark%3BVan+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick%3BWithagen%2C+Cees+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1465582&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Estimating the Economic Impact of the Permafrost Carbon Feedback,"The permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) is not currently taken into account in economic assessments of climate change, yet it could have important implications for the social cost of carbon (SCC) and the associated choice of the optimal greenhouse gas emission pathway. Although this feedback is still imperfectly known, there are enough estimates of its potential strength to now include it in our assessments. In this paper, I present a model of the PCF and integrate this feedback in the DICE Integrated Assessment Model to examine its consequences. I find that doing so increases the SCC by 10-20% in the baseline scenario, but that this impact is much more significant in the case of a damage function which is more reactive to very high temperature changes, and can reach up to 220%. It follows that setting industrial emission targets without taking this feedback into account would lead to excessive atmospheric carbon. I find that it increases the optimal emission control rate by circa 5% points on average over the period 2015-2110 and that this difference becomes much more significant when the constraint of limiting the increase in global mean temperature to +2 degrees C or +1.5 degrees C is added to the model.",1,1958559476, 1663793,Scholarly Journals,,"Kessler, Louise",," Kessler, Louise",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, May 2017,,2010-0078,2, English, English, 1-23,May 2017,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,8,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1958559476?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 8, no. 2, May 2017, pp. 1-23", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Estimating+the+Economic+Impact+of+the+Permafrost+Carbon+Feedback&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2017-05-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Kessler%2C+Louise&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1663793&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Cleaning the Bathwater with the Baby: The Health Co-Benefits of Carbon Pricing in Transportation,"Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the US have relied on Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards and Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS). Economists often argue that these policies are inefficient relative to carbon pricing because they ignore existing vehicles and do not adequately reduce the incentive to drive. This paper presents evidence that the net social costs of carbon pricing are significantly less than previous thought. The bias arises from the fact that the demand elasticity for miles travelled varies systematically with vehicle emissions; dirtier vehicles are more responsive to changes in gasoline prices. This is true for all four emissions for which we have data--nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and greenhouse gases--as well as weight. This reduces the net social costs associated with carbon pricing through increasing the co-benefits. Accounting for this heterogeneity implies that the welfare losses from $1.00 gas tax, or a $110 per ton of CO2 tax, are negative over the period of 1998 to 2008 even when we ignore the climate change benefits from the tax. Co-benefits increase by over 60 percent relative to ignoring the heterogeneity that we document. In addition, accounting for this heterogeneity raises the optimal gas tax associated with local pollution, as calculated by Parry and Small (2005), by as much as 57 percent.

Incorporating 'Catastrophic' Climate Change into Policy Analysis,"Although existing economic research is informative with regard to the importance of including potential 'catastrophic' climate change impacts in the analysis of GHG mitigation benefits, the generic and abstract form of the 'catastrophe' implemented has led to a lack of specific policy implications. This article provides an important starting point for a discussion of how to improve economic modelling of potential large-scale impacts of climate change. It considers how the term 'abrupt climate change' has been used in the scientific literature to describe changes in the climate system and carefully reviews the characteristics of the events that have been discussed in this context. The findings are compared to the way in which the economic literature has modelled potential economic and human welfare impacts of these 'catastrophic' events. In general, the economics literature is found to have modelled such impacts in a uniform way that fails to account for differences in relevant end points and timescales. The result is policy recommendations based on events that do not resemble those of concern. Better treatment of these events in integrated assessment modelling would help ensure that future research efforts can serve as meaningful policy input. Policy relevance--It has often been stated that current studies aimed at understanding the magnitude of optimal climate policy fail to adequately capture the potential for 'catastrophic' impacts of climate change. Existing economic modelling has provided evidence that, in general, potential climate catastrophes might significantly influence the optimal path of abatement. However, there is a need to move beyond experiments that are detached from important details of the climate problem to substantively inform the policy debate and improve analyses of GHG mitigation benefits (e.g. social cost of carbon estimates). This article identifies areas where modelling could be improved even within current frameworks and others where additional work is needed.",1,1751980646, 1533904,Scholarly Journals,,"Kopits, Elizabeth;Marten, Alex;Wolverton, Ann",," Kopits, Elizabeth",, Journal Article, 1752-7457,"  0, 2014",,1469-3062,5, English, English, 637-664,"0, 2014",Climate Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,14,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751980646?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 14, no. 5, 2014, pp. 637-64", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, 637," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Incorporating+%27Catastrophic%27+Climate+Change+into+Policy+Analysis&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=14&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=637&amp;au=Kopits%2C+Elizabeth%3BMarten%2C+Alex%3BWolverton%2C+Ann&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1533904&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Influence of the Specification of Climate Change Damages on the Social Cost of Carbon,"Drawing upon climate change damage specifications previously proposed in the literature that the authors have calibrated to a common level of damages at 2.5[superscript o]C, the authors examine the effect upon the social cost of carbon (SCC) of varying damage specifications in a DICE-like integrated assessment model. They find that SCC estimates are highly sensitive to uncertainty in extrapolating damages to high temperatures at moderate-to-high levels of risk aversion, but only modestly so at low levels of risk aversion. While in the absence of risk aversion, all of the SCC estimates but one agree within a factor of two, with a moderate level of risk aversion included, the differences among estimates grow greatly. For example, one composite damage specification, combining elements of different literature-derived specifications and roughly taking into account calibration uncertainty, yields SCC values 32% higher than the standard quadratic DICE damage function in the absence of risk aversion. With a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1.4, however, the same uncertain specification yields SCC values almost triple those of the standard function. The authors conclude that failure to consider damages uncertainty and risk aversion jointly can lead to significant underestimation of the SCC.",1,1462182574, 1402197,Scholarly Journals,,"Kopp, Robert E;Golub, Alexander;Keohane, Nathaniel O;Onda, Chikara",," Kopp, Robert E",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2012",,1864-6042,, English, English,,"0, 2012","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2012,, American Economic Association,6,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1462182574?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 6, 2012", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Influence+of+the+Specification+of+Climate+Change+Damages+on+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kopp%2C+Robert+E%3BGolub%2C+Alexander%3BKeohane%2C+Nathaniel+O%3BOnda%2C+Chikara&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1402197&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

The social cost of carbon and inequality: when local redistribution shapes global carbon prices,"The social cost of carbon is the central economic measure for aggregate climate change damages and functions as a metric for optimal carbon prices. Previous literature shows that inequality significantly influences the level of the social cost of carbon, but mostly neglects a major source of inequality--heterogeneity in income below the national level. We characterize the relationship between climate and redistributional policy in an optimal taxation model that explicitly accounts for inequality between and within countries. In particular, we demonstrate that climate and distributional policy cannot be separated when national governments fail to compensate low-income households for climate change damages: Even if only one country does not compensate especially affected households, the social cost of carbon increases globally. Further, we use numerical methods to estimate the scope of these effects. Our results suggest that it is crucial to correct previous estimates of the social cost of carbon for national distributional policies.",0,2314547992, 1797071,Working Papers,,"Kornek, Ulrike;Klenert, David;Edenhofer, Ottmar;Fleurbaey, Marc"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Kornek, Ulrike",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2019",,,, English, English,,"0, 2019","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7628, 2019", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2019," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7628"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7628",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2314547992?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7628, 2019", [URL:https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp7628.pdf] URL,," Distribution: General (D30) , Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement (D63) , Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , optimal taxation, inequality, climate change, social cost of carbon",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+social+cost+of+carbon+and+inequality%3A+when+local+redistribution+shapes+global+carbon+prices&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kornek%2C+Ulrike%3BKlenert%2C+David%3BEdenhofer%2C+Ottmar%3BFleurbaey%2C+Marc&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1797071&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Risk Premia and the Social Cost of Carbon: A Review,"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions not only lowers expected damages from climate change but also reduces the risk of catastrophic impacts. However, estimates of the social cost of carbon, which measures the marginal value of carbon dioxide abatement, often do not capture this risk reduction benefit. Risk-averse individuals are willing to pay a risk premium, an additional amount beyond the difference in expected damages, to reduce risks. The authors review methods used and estimates obtained for calculating a risk premium to be included in the social cost of carbon. While more research is needed in this area, work to date suggests a positive, and potentially substantial, risk premium on the social cost of carbon is warranted.",0,925698597, 1281574,Scholarly Journals,,"Kousky, Carolyn;Kopp, Robert E;Cooke, Roger",," Kousky, Carolyn",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2011",,1864-6042,, English, English,,"0, 2011","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2011,, American Economic Association,5,https://search.proquest.com/docview/925698597?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 5, 2011", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL,," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Global , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Risk+Premia+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon%3A+A+Review&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kousky%2C+Carolyn%3BKopp%2C+Robert+E%3BCooke%2C+Roger&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1281574&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Trade-off between Intra- and Intergenerational Equity in Climate Policy,"This paper focuses on two equity dimensions of climate policy, intra- and intergenerational equity, and analyzes the implications of equity preferences on climate policy, and on the production and consumption patterns in rich and poor countries. We develop a dynamic two-region model, in which each region suffers from local pollution and global warming, but also has an inequality aversion over current consumption allocations. Inequality aversion lifts the consumption path of the poor region, while the rich region must take a greater share of the climate burden. Furthermore, with inequality aversion, the optimal climate policy leads to higher investment in clean capital in the North and in dirty capital in the South, thereby allowing the South to pollute more and develop faster. The optimal policy may even require the poor region to increase emissions relative to the uncoordinated business-as-usual case. Introducing transfers between the regions reinforces these effects. However, loans to poor countries to reduce inequality may result in a debt crisis, and hence, debt remittance may be part of the optimal climate policy.",1,1416033151, 1377523,Working Papers,,"Kverndokk, Snorre;Naevdal, Eric;Nostbakken, Linda"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Kverndokk, Snorre",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4285, 2013", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2013," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4285"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4285",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1416033151?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4285, 2013", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2013/wp-cesifo-2013-06/cesifo1_wp4285. pdf] URL,," Computational Techniques, Simulation Modeling (C63) , Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement (D63) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , intragenerational equity, intergenerational equity, inequality aversion, climate policy, economic development, international transfers, debt crisis",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Trade-off+between+Intra-+and+Intergenerational+Equity+in+Climate+Policy&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kverndokk%2C+Snorre%3BNaevdal%2C+Eric%3BNostbakken%2C+Linda&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1377523&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Three Essays on Incomplete Climate Policy in a Second-Best World,"Policies to address climate change may not be optimal for several reasons. Policies may emerge through distortionary decisionmaking, reflecting disagreement among decisionmakers as to the extent that climate change should be addressed. Policies may be incomplete, i.e., only cover a subset of sectors or jurisdictions and thus be susceptible to carbon leakage, as unregulated agents respond to market forces by altering their emissions. Finally, policies may have unintended interactions with pre-existing regulations or other unpriced externalities which may far exceed the external benefits from reducing GHG emissions. Across three papers, this dissertation explores these aspects of U.S. climate policies. Chapter 1 explores how disagreement among policymakers impacts federal and state efforts to address climate change and empirically examines which effort is likely to come closest to achieving an optimal climate policy. I find that federal policy results in a substantially greater scientific welfare gain than state policies with trading, of $14.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, although neither policy is optimal. In Chapter 2, Antonio M. Bento, Richard Klotz and I, link a multi-market economic model with an emissions model to quantify the importance of carbon leakage relative to the intended emissions savings resulting from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for conventional biofuels. The expansion of biofuels mandated by the RFS can increase or decrease emissions depending on the policy regime being evaluated with the most recent policy regime corresponding to a reduction in emissions of 2.0 TgCO2e in 2015. Chapter 3 examines why policymakers frequently use a single policy instrument to address multiple market failures, as was the case for the RFS for conventional biofuels. Antonio M. Bento and I perform a comprehensive welfare assessment of that policy, finding that the RFS consistently fails a benefit-cost test, with net costs totaling $1.6 billion in 2015. Each dollar reduction in the external costs of oil dependency comes at the expense of additional environmental external costs of $0.90. Our results suggest that policymakers may use a single instrument to address multiple market failures, less out of a regard for efficiency, but to increase the likelihood that a policy passes.",0,1751983985, 1537386,Dissertations & Theses,,"Landry, Joel",," Landry, Joel",, Dissertation,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","Cornell University, 2014", CSAPTdissertations,2014, Cornell University, American Economic Association  Cornell University,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751983985?accountid=14505," Cornell University, 2014",,," Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate , Fuel , Oil , Regulation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:EconLit&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+Essays+on+Incomplete+Climate+Policy+in+a+Second-Best+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Landry%2C+Joel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1537386&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Welfare Effects of Biofuel Policies in the Presence of Environmental Externalities and Pre-existing Distortions,"Policy intervention in the biofuel market has led to a significant increase in biofuel production and use in the past several years. However, the welfare effect of biofuel policies, specifically the ethanol tax credit for corn ethanol, ethanol import tariff and renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandate has not been adequately examined. Moreover, the environmental impact of these policies, and their impact on fuel taxation has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. This dissertation examines the market and welfare effects of biofuel policies in the US, specifically those relating to corn and sugarcane ethanol, with the aim of determining the welfare implications of existing policies, and designing second-best optimal policies. In measuring welfare effects, changes in social surplus, as well as environmental externalities are taken into account. In addition, the interaction of fuel and biofuel policies with the broader fiscal system is also considered. This dissertation consists of three papers. In the first paper, a stylized model of the US miles and fuel market, including ethanol trade is developed to quantify the market and welfare effects of biofuel policies in the US. In order to examine the effect of the ethanol tax credit and import tariff several market scenarios are simulated. The market outcome with the two policies in place are compared to a non-intervention scenario, and an optimal baseline where Pigouvian taxes are levied on fuel and miles. Results show that the effect of the tax credit on social surplus is clearly negative, while the impact of the tariff depends on the ability of the US to influence ethanol prices in the world market. Numerical simulations show that the existing ethanol tax credit and import tariff increase miles externalities and GHG emissions and decrease social welfare by $5.9 B relative to non-intervention and by $235 B relative to the optimal scenario. In the second paper, detailed production data on ethanol production costs in the US and Brazil are used together with a numerical model of US biofuel trade with Brazil to quantify the welfare effect of the USRFS mandate for traditional and advanced biofuel (excluding cellulosic and biomass biodiesel) under various scenarios on the currency exchange rate between the US dollar and Brazilian reais. Numerical results show that in 2015, the cost of the mandate is lower when the US currency is appreciated relative to the Brazilian currency, and when the excess supply elasticity of ethanol from Brazil is more elastic. Relative to a baseline without a mandate but with an ethanol subsidy and import tariff in place, GHG emissions decrease and the welfare effect of the mandate ranges from -$23 to +$5 Billion dollars as the exchange rate varies from US$1 = R$1.81 to US$1 = R$3.11. The third paper analyzes the impact of biofuel policies and biofuel use on the second-best optimal carbon tax for fuels in the presence of a labor tax and a biofuel subsidy. Findings show that when biofuel is part of the fuel mix, the carbon tax has a commodity price effect which arises from tax-induced changes in land rent. The commodity price effect could exacerbate or attenuate the tax interaction effect caused by higher fuel prices, depending on the elasticity of substitution between gasoline and biofuel, the price elasticity of miles demand, and the relative emissions intensity of gasoline and biofuel. Numerical results show that the commodity price effect affects the value of the second-best optimal carbon tax, and that the effect is greater if the elasticity of substitution between gasoline and ethanol is higher, miles demand is more price inelastic, and the emissions intensity of biofuel is lower relative to gasoline. In addition, the existence of a fixed biofuel subsidy lead to a greater divergence between the value of the second-best optimal carbon tax with or without biofuels. A carbon tax policy decreases GHG emissions and increases welfare, in contrast to a biofuel subsidy, which also decreases GHG emissions but at a net welfare loss.",0,821273187, 1142846,Dissertations & Theses,,"Lasco, Marie Christine Dionela",," Lasco, Marie Christine Dionela",, Dissertation,,"  0, 2010",,,, English, English,,"0, 2010","University of Illinois, 2010", CSAPTdissertations,2010, University of Illinois, American Economic Association  University of Illinois,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/821273187?accountid=14505," University of Illinois, 2010",,," Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , U.S. , Northern America , Ethanol , Fuel",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:EconLit&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Welfare+Effects+of+Biofuel+Policies+in+the+Presence+of+Environmental+Externalities+and+Pre-existing+Distortions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lasco%2C+Marie+Christine+Dionela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1142846&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Tipping Points and Ambiguity in the Economics of Climate Change,"We model welfare-maximizing policy in an infinite-horizon setting when the probability of a tipping point, the welfare change due to a tipping point, and knowledge about a tipping point's trigger all depend on the policy path. Analytic results demonstrate how optimal policy depends on the ability to affect both the probability of a tipping point and also welfare in a post-threshold world. Simulations with a numerical climate-economy model show that possible tipping points in the climate system increase the optimal near-term carbon tax by up to 45% in base case specifications. The resulting policy paths lower peak warming by up to 0.5 degree C compared to a model without possible tipping points. Different types of tipping points have qualitatively different effects on policy, demonstrating the importance of explicitly modeling tipping points' effects on system dynamics.

Tipping points and ambiguity in the integrated assessment of climate change,"The threat of crossing tipping points in the climate system often serves as an argument for more stringent greenhouse gas emission reductions. We introduce such regime shifts into a recursive relative of the DICE integrated assessment model for determining optimal climate policies. Each period's carbon dioxide concentration determines the probability of crossing a tipping point, and the policymaker re-optimizes once a tipping point occurs. The probability, timing, and knowledge of tipping points are endogenous. Our policymaker can also display ambiguity aversion in assessing tipping point uncertainty. We find that tipping points increase the near-term social cost of carbon by 50-100% when they raise climate sensitivity or make damages more convex. They have less of an effect when they increase the atmospheric lifetime of CO2 or the quantity of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Uncertainty about tipping points can reduce their effect on policy. The possibility of tipping points is more important for the social cost of carbon than is the ambiguity attitude used in their evaluation.",0,847269999, 1146101,Working Papers,,"Lemoine, Derek M;Traeger, Christian P"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Lemoine, Derek M",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2010",,,, English, English,,"0, 2010","Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Working Paper Series, 2010", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2010," Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Working Paper Series"," American Economic Association  Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Working Paper Series",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/847269999?accountid=14505," Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Department of Agricultural & Resource Economics, UC Berkeley, Working Paper Series, 2010", [URL:http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/9nd591ww.pdf;origin=repeccitec] URL,,,https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Tipping+points+and+ambiguity+in+the+integrated+assessment+of+climate+change&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lemoine%2C+Derek+M%3BTraeger%2C+Christian+P&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1146101&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
A Quantitative Estimate on the Global Optimal Carbon Tax. (In Chinese. With English summary.),"Emissions of carbon dioxide have global externalities, so carbon mitigation needs estimates on global optimal carbon tax. This paper constructs an IAM model, DICE-E, based on Nordhaus' DICE-2007. Its major novelty is the endogenous consumption of fossil fuels. Calibration of parameters and evaluation of initialization are updated. Numerical simulation indicates that the optimal carbon tax in 2010 is RMB 91.9 (2010 constant price) per metric ton of carbon emitted, which is lower a bit than the result of DICE-2007. However, the rising speed of carbon tax is faster in DICE-E. If carbon tax will be implemented in 2015, a suggestion can be delivered based on our calculations: for gasoline 93, carbon tax begins at RMB 0.1 per liter, increases 1 cent annually and reaches RMB 0.15 per liter at 2020.",0,1640476308, 1469623,Scholarly Journals,,"Li, Bin",," Li, Bin",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2013",,1000-3894,4, Chinese, Chinese, 19-33,"0, 2013",Journal of Quantitative and Technical Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,30,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1640476308?accountid=14505," Journal of Quantitative and Technical Economics, vol. 30, no. 4, 2013, pp. 19-33", [URL:http://www.jqte.net] Publisher's URL, 19," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , International Fiscal Issues, International Public Goods (H87) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , Externalities , Tax",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Quantitative+Estimate+on+the+Global+Optimal+Carbon+Tax.+%28In+Chinese.+With+English+summary.%29&amp;title=Journal+of+Quantitative+and+Technical+Economics&amp;issn=10003894&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=30&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=19&amp;au=Li%2C+Bin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Quantitative+and+Technical+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1469623&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Climate Policy and Induced R&amp;D: How Great is the Effect?,"Carbon taxes or tradable permit systems to address climate change may induce research and development in energy-related technologies. We construct a single-knowledge-stock model of R&D, growth and climate to assess the importance of this effect. The contribution of induced R&D is shown to be very sensitive to (i) the duplication externality, (ii) the feasibility of dedicated research subsidies to internalize inter-firm knowledge spillovers, (iii) the opportunity cost of R&D, (iv) the initial level of research expenditure, and (v) the elasticity of substitution between energy and other factors of production. In contrast, the direction and scale of the inter-temporal research spillover is of secondary importance. We find strong support for Rezai's (2011) argument that, when the business-as-usual scenario (no policy) is modeled appropriately (all externalities treated as external), sacrifices for early generations associated with optimal climate policy are minor or non-existent. Employing our preferred selections for the parameters, we find that adding an induced R&D component to the model increases the welfare impact of the first-best policy (optimally chosen carbon tax and research subsidies) by an average value of more than 400 percent, and of the second-best policy (carbon tax alone) by approximately 22 percent.",0,1566807918, 1457971,Working Papers,,"Lyssenko, Nikita;Shiell, Leslie"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Lyssenko, Nikita",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English, 55,"0, 2014","University of Ottawa, Department of Economics, Working Papers: E1405E, 2014, 55 pp.", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," University of Ottawa, Department of Economics, Working Papers: E1405E"," American Economic Association  University of Ottawa, Department of Economics, Working Papers: E1405E",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1566807918?accountid=14505," University of Ottawa, Department of Economics, Working Papers: E1405E, 2014, 55 pp.", [URL:http://www.sciencessociales.uottawa.ca/sites/default/files/public/eco/1405E.pdf] URL, 55," Energy: General (Q40) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , induced technological change, climate policy modeling",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Policy+and+Induced+R%26amp%3BD%3A+How+Great+is+the+Effect%3F&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=55&amp;au=Lyssenko%2C+Nikita%3BShiell%2C+Leslie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1457971&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Essays on Structural Transformation,"The three chapters of this dissertation investigate major topics on structural transformation--reallocation of production across broad sectors of the economy. The first chapter investigates how substitutable are the demand for goods in the U.S. and its relationship to income elasticity. The second chapter studies the relationship between the reallocation of production and energy use in the United States. Lastly, the third chapter analyzes the structural transformation process of the Brazilian economy from 1950-2010. In Chapter 1, I study the importance of changes in income and relative prices for the consumption demand between agriculture, manufacturing and services goods in the U.S. I use an (indirect) utility representation that takes the commonly used Stone-Geary preferences as special case and is able to generate persistent income effects. I find that a fairly low value of the substitution parameter, but sustained income effects. In Chapter 2, I study the role of structural transformation--from goods towards services--and of the increase in energy-saving productivity in the decline of carbon intensity (carbon emission per output) in the U.S. from 1950 to 2015. Because services require relatively less energy for production, shifts toward this sector decreases the necessary energy for production and, as consequence, less carbon per unit produced. Energy-saving productivity, on the other hand, reduces the necessary energy input for each unit of production. I use a multi-sector model to quantify the effects of energy-saving productivity in the economy. I find that in the absence of energy-saving productivity growth, aggregate consumption would be 6.2% lower than observed in 2015 and labor share in the goods sector 6.1% higher. In addition, I find that energy-saving productivity growth is responsible for 71.5% of the decline in carbon intensity (carbon emission per output) and structural transformation is of minor importance. I also use the model to evaluate the effects of implementing a per unit energy tax equal to the social cost of carbon provided by the Energy Information Agency. The tax decreases aggregate consumption by 3.5% and it increases the labor share in the goods sector by 1.61%. Finally, Chapter 3, jointly with Daniela Costa, examines the labor reallocation across agriculture, manufacturing and services, and their impacts on aggregate labor productivity in Brazil from 1950 to 2010. We use a multisector model that features nonhomothetic preferences and constant elasticity of substitution to decompose the drivers of the labor reallocation. For the entire 1950-2010 period, the income effect accounts for most of the reallocation of labor away from agriculture towards manufacturing and services. On the other hand, if we focus only in the 1980-2010 sub-period, the relative price change is now the main driver of the reallocation of labor, even though income effect is still quantitatively important. In addition, we explore two important aspects of the Brazilian economy: the fast growth of manufacturing productivity from 1950 to 1980 and its subsequent sluggish behavior, and the decline of services labor productivity after 1980. We find that the fast growth of manufacturing productivity between 1950 and 1980 is responsible for 15% of the aggregate productivity level in 1980. We also find that if services labor productivity had stayed constant at its 1980 level, aggregate labor productivity in 2010 would be 28% higher than observed.",0,2330596163, 1808057,Dissertations & Theses,,"Marcolino, Marcos",," Marcolino, Marcos",, Dissertation,,"  0, 2018",,,, English, English,,"0, 2018","University of Minnesota, 2018", CSAPTdissertations,2018, University of Minnesota, American Economic Association  University of Minnesota,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2330596163?accountid=14505," University of Minnesota, 2018",,," Human Capital, Skills, Occupational Choice, Labor Productivity (J240) , Industrial Organization and Macroeconomics: Industrial Structure and Structural Change, Industrial Price Indices (L160) , Industry Studies: Manufacturing: General (L600) , Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O110) , Energy: Government Policy (Q480) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q580) , Brazil , U.S. , Latin America and the Caribbean , Northern America , Energy , Labor Productivity , Manufacturing , Productivity",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:EconLit&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+Structural+Transformation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marcolino%2C+Marcos&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1808057&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Role of Scenario Uncertainty in Estimating the Benefits of Carbon Mitigation,"The benefits of carbon mitigation are subject to numerous sources of uncertainty and accounting for this uncertainty in policy analysis is crucial. One often overlooked source uncertainty are the forecasts of future baseline conditions (e.g., population, economic output, emissions) from which carbon mitigation benefits are assessed. Through, in some cases highly non-linear relationships, these baseline conditions determine the forecast level and rate of climate change, exposed populations, vulnerability, and way in which inter-temporal tradeoffs are valued. We study the impact of explicitly considering this uncertainty on a widely used metric to assess the benefits of carbon dioxide mitigation, the social cost of carbon (SCC). To explore this question, a detailed integrated assessment that couples economic and climate systems to assess the damages of climate change is driven by a library of consistent probabilistic socioeconomic-emission scenarios developed using a comprehensive global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We find that scenario uncertainty has a significant effect on estimates of the SCC and that excluding this source of uncertainty could lead to an underestimate of the mitigation benefits. A detailed decomposition finds that this effect is driven primarily through the role that uncertainty regarding future consumption per capita growth has on the value of inter-temporal tradeoffs through the consumption discount rate.",1,1677360468, 1488923,Scholarly Journals,,"Marten, Alex L",," Marten, Alex L",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, August 2014,,2010-0078,3, English, English, 1-29,August 2014,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,5,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1677360468?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 5, no. 3, August 2014, pp. 1-29", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Computable and Other Applied General Equilibrium Models (D58) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , CGE , Climate , Computable General Equilibrium , Equilibrium , General Equilibrium",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Role+of+Scenario+Uncertainty+in+Estimating+the+Benefits+of+Carbon+Mitigation&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2014-08-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Marten%2C+Alex+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1488923&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Transient Temperature Response Modeling in IAMs: The Effects of Over Simplification on the SCC,"Integrated assessment models (IAMs) couple representations of the natural climate system with models of the global economy to evaluate climate and energy policies. Such models are currently used to derive the benefits of carbon mitigation policies through estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC). To remain tractable these models often utilize highly simplified representations of complex natural, social, and economic systems. The authors consider three prominent IAMs, DICE, FUND, and PAGE, and compare their highly simplified temperature response models to two upwelling diffusion energy balance models that better reflect the progressive heat uptake of the deep ocean. They find that all three IAMs fail to fully capture important characteristics in the dynamics of temperature response, especially for high equilibrium climate sensitivities. This has serious implications given these models are often run with distributions for the equilibrium climate sensitivity which have a positive probability for such states of the world. The authors find that, all else equal, the temperature response model in FUND can lead to estimates of the expected SCC that are 1,075% lower than those derived using more realistic climate models, while the models in DICE and PAGE lead to expected SCC estimates that are 10,110% and 40,260% higher, respectively.",0,925698575, 1281571,Scholarly Journals,,"Marten, Alex L",," Marten, Alex L",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2011",,1864-6042,, English, English,,"0, 2011","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2011,, American Economic Association,5,https://search.proquest.com/docview/925698575?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 5, 2011", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL,," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Global , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Transient+Temperature+Response+Modeling+in+IAMs%3A+The+Effects+of+Over+Simplification+on+the+SCC&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marten%2C+Alex+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1281571&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Incremental CH4 and N2O Mitigation Benefits Consistent with the US Government's SC-CO2 Estimates,"Benefit-cost analysis can serve as an informative input into the policy-making process, but only to the degree it characterizes the major impacts of the regulation under consideration. Recently, the US, amongst other nations, has begun to use estimates of the social cost of CO2 (SC-CO2) to develop analyses that more fully capture the climate change impacts of GHG abatement. The SC-CO2 represents the aggregate willingness to pay to avoid the damages associated with an additional tonne of CO2 emissions. In comparison, the social costs of non-CO2 GHGs have received little attention from researchers and policy analysts, despite their non-negligible climate impact. This article addresses this issue by developing a set of social cost estimates for two highly prevalent non-CO2 GHGs, methane and nitrous oxide. By extending existing integrated assessment models, it is possible to develop a set of social cost estimates for these gases that are consistent with the SC-CO2 estimates currently in use by the US federal government. Policy relevance-Within the benefit-cost analyses that inform the design of major regulations, all Federal agencies within the US Government (USG) use a set of agreed upon SC-CO2 estimates to value the impact of CO2 emissions changes. However, the value of changes in non-CO2 GHG emissions has not been included in USG policy analysis to date. This article addresses that omission by developing a set of social cost estimates for two highly prevalent non-CO2 GHGs, methane and nitrous oxide. These new estimates are designed to be compatible with the USG SC-CO2 estimates currently in use and may therefore be directly applied to value emissions changes for these non-CO2 gases within the benefit-cost analyses used to evaluate future policies.",1,1751981918, 1533929,Scholarly Journals,,"Marten, Alex L;Kopits, Elizabeth A;Griffiths, Charles W;Newbold, Stephen C;Wolverton, Ann",," Marten, Alex L",, Journal Article, 1752-7457,"  0, 2015",,1469-3062,2, English, English, 272-298,"0, 2015",Climate Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2015,, American Economic Association,15,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751981918?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 15, no. 2, 2015, pp. 272-98", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, 272," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Benefit Cost , Climate , Regulation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Incremental+CH4+and+N2O+Mitigation+Benefits+Consistent+with+the+US+Government%27s+SC-CO2+Estimates&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=15&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=272&amp;au=Marten%2C+Alex+L%3BKopits%2C+Elizabeth+A%3BGriffiths%2C+Charles+W%3BNewbold%2C+Stephen+C%3BWolverton%2C+Ann&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1533929&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

The Effect of CO2 Pricing on Conventional and Non-Conventional Oil Supply and Demand,"What would be the effect of CO2 pricing on global oil supply and demand? This paper introduces a model describing the interaction between conventional and non-conventional oil supply in a Hotelling framework and under CO2 constraints. The model assumes that nonconventional crude oil enters the market when conventional oil supply alone is unable to meet demand, and the social cost of CO2 is included in the calculation of the oil rent at that time. The results reveal the effect of a CO2 tax set at the social cost of CO2 on oil price and demand and the uncertainty associated with the time when conventional oil production might become unable to meet demand. The results show that a tax on CO2 emissions associated with fuel use would reduce oil demand despite the effect of lower future rents, and would delay the time when conventional oil supply is unable to satisfy demand. More precisely, between 81 and 99% of the CO2 tax is carried into the oil price despite the counter-balancing effect of the reduced rent. A CO2 tax on fuel use set at the social cost of CO2 would delay by 25 years the time when conventional oil production is unable to meet oil demand, from 2019 to 2044 (mean value). The results show that this date is very sensitive to the price elasticity of demand and the demand growth rate, which shows the great potential of demand-side measures to smooth the transition towards low-carbon liquid fuel alternatives.",0,821269422, 1139001,Working Papers,,"Mejean, Aurelie;Hope, Chris"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Mejean, Aurelie",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2010",,,, English, English,,"0, 2010","Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics, 2010", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2010," Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics"," American Economic Association  Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/821269422?accountid=14505," Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics, 2010", [URL:http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/dae/repec/cam/pdf/cwpe1054.pdf] URL,," Energy: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q41) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy Forecasting (Q47) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Oil supply and demand , Conventional and non-conventional oil , CO2 pricing , Social cost of CO2.",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Effect+of+CO2+Pricing+on+Conventional+and+Non-Conventional+Oil+Supply+and+Demand&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mejean%2C+Aurelie%3BHope%2C+Chris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1139001&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Supplying Synthetic Crude Oil from Canadian Oil Sands: A Comparative Study of the Costs and CO2 Emissions of Mining and In-Situ Recovery,"High crude oil prices and the eventual decline of conventional oil production raise the issue of alternative fuels such as non-conventional oil. The paper describes a simple probabilistic model of the costs of synthetic crude oil (SCO) produced from Canadian oil sands. Synthetic crude oil is obtained by upgrading bitumen that is first produced through mining or in-situ recovery techniques. This forward-looking analysis quantifies the effects of learning and production constraints on the costs of supplying synthetic crude oil from Canadian bitumen deposits. The results show the uncertainties associated with the future costs of synthetic crude oil. Carbon costs have a large impact of the total costs of synthetic crude oil, in particular in the case of synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen, due to the carbon-intensity of the recovery techniques. The influence of each parameter on the supply costs is examined. In the case of mined SCO, the maximum production rate, the ultimate recovery rate and the depletion parameters show the largest influence on the results, while learning parameters dominate in the case of in-situ SCO.",1,742855530, 1102957,Working Papers,,"Mejean, Aurelie;Hope, Chris"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Mejean, Aurelie",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2010",,,, English, English,,"0, 2010","Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics, 2010", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2010," Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics"," American Economic Association  Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/742855530?accountid=14505," Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics, 2010", [URL:http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/dae/repec/cam/pdf/cwpe1014.pdf] URL,," Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Energy Forecasting (Q47) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Non-conventional oil , Uncertainty , Social cost of carbon",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Supplying+Synthetic+Crude+Oil+from+Canadian+Oil+Sands%3A+A+Comparative+Study+of+the+Costs+and+CO2+Emissions+of+Mining+and+In-Situ+Recovery&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mejean%2C+Aurelie%3BHope%2C+Chris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1102957&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Using Economic Instruments to Address Emissions from Air Transport in the European Union,"Air transport has become a vital component of the global economy. However, greenhouse-gas emissions from this sector have a significant impact on global climate, being responsible for over 3.5% of all anthropogenic radiative forcing. Also, the accrued visibility of aircraft emissions greatly affects the public image of the industry. In this context, incentive-based regulations, in the form of price or quantity controls, can be envisaged as alternatives to mitigate these emissions. The use of environmental charges in air transport, and the inclusion of the sector in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), are considered under a range of scenarios. The impacts of these measures on demand are estimated, and results suggest that they are likely to be minimal--mainly due to the high willingness to pay for air transport. In particular, in the EU ETS scenario currently favoured by the EU, demand reductions are less than 2%. This may not be true in the longer run, for short trips, or if future caps become more stringent. Furthermore, given current estimates of the social cost of CO2 as well as typical EU ETS prices, supply-side abatement would be too costly to be encouraged by these policies in the short term. The magnitude of aviation CO2 emissions in the EU is estimated, both in physical and monetary terms; the results are consistent with Eurocontrol estimates and, for the EU-25, the total social cost of these emissions represents only 0.03% of the region's GDP. It is concluded that the use of multisector policies, such as the EU ETS, is unsuitable for curbing emissions from air transport, and that stringent emission charges or an isolated ETS would be better instruments. However, the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS has advantages under target-oriented post-2012 scenarios, such as policy-costs dilution, certainty in reductions, and flexibility in abatement allocation. This solution is also attractive to airlines, as it would improve their public image but require virtually no reduction of their own emissions, as they would be fully capable of passing on policy costs to their customers.",1,56823825, 0962216,Scholarly Journals,,"Mendes, Lucas M Z;Santos, Georgina",," Mendes, Lucas M Z",, Journal Article, 1472-3409, January 2008,,0308-518X,1, English, English, 189-209,January 2008,Environment and Planning A," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2008,, American Economic Association,40,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56823825?accountid=14505," Environment and Planning A, vol. 40, no. 1, January 2008, pp. 189-209", [URL:http://epn.sagepub.com/content/by/year] Publisher's URL, 189," Air Transportation (L93) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , EU , Europe , Airline , Aviation , Climate , Regulation , Transport",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Using+Economic+Instruments+to+Address+Emissions+from+Air+Transport+in+the+European+Union&amp;title=Environment+and+Planning+A&amp;issn=0308518X&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=40&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=189&amp;au=Mendes%2C+Lucas+M+Z%3BSantos%2C+Georgina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Environment+and+Planning+A&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0962216&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Integrated Assessment Models and the Social Cost of Carbon: A Review and Assessment of U.S. Experience,"This article considers the role of integrated assessment models (IAMs) in estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC) for U.S. regulatory purposes. Our perspective is rooted in the needs of U.S. institutions responsible for designing and implementing climate policy, specifically regulatory agencies within the executive branch and Congress should it choose to take up climate legislation. We argue that policymakers need a numerical value for the SCC for policy evaluation and implementation and that producing a credible numerical value requires sophisticated computer models that incorporate climate and economic considerations, that is, IAMs. We also argue that whatever the true value of the SCC, it is not zero, although there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the current state of scientific knowledge about the costs of climate change. We conclude that the evolving nature of the science and the ultimate goal of informing first-best policy suggests that the official SCC used for regulatory analysis by the U.S. government should not be thought of as a single number or even a range of numbers; rather it should be thought of more broadly as a process that yields updated estimates of those numbers and ranges.

An Economic Anatomy of Optimal Climate Policy,"This paper introduces geoengineering into an optimal control model of climate change economics. Together with mitigation and adaptation, carbon and solar geoengineering span the universe of possible climate policies. Their wildly different characteristics have important implications for climate policy. We show in the context of our model that: (i) the optimal carbon tax equals the marginal cost of carbon geoengineering; (ii) the introduction of either form of geoengineering leads to higher emissions yet lower temperatures; (iii) in a world with above-optimal cumulative emissions, only a complete set of instruments can minimize climate damages.",1,2064750476, 1709312,Working Papers,,"Moreno-Cruz, Juan;Wagner, Gernot;Keith, David W"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Moreno-Cruz, Juan",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2018",,,, English, English,,"0, 2018","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7059, 2018", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2018," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7059"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7059",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2064750476?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7059, 2018", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp7059.pdf] URL,," Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: General (D90) , Environment and Growth (O44) , Energy: Government Policy (Q48) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , climate change, climate policy, mitigation, adaptation, carbon geoengineering, carbon dioxide removal, solar geoengineering, solar radiation management",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=An+Economic+Anatomy+of+Optimal+Climate+Policy&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moreno-Cruz%2C+Juan%3BWagner%2C+Gernot%3BKeith%2C+David+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1709312&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Climate Impacts on Economic Growth as Drivers of Uncertainty in the Social Cost of Carbon,"We reexamine estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) used by agencies as the price of carbon emissions in cost-benefit analysis, focusing on those by the federal Interagency Working Group on SCC (IWG). We show that the models used by the IWG assume continued economic growth in the face of substantial temperature increases, which suggests that they may not capture the full range of possible consequences of climate change. Using the DICE integrated assessment model, we examine the possibility that climate change may directly affect productivity and find that even a modest impact of this type increases SCC estimates substantially. The SCC appears to be highly uncertain and sensitive to modeling assumptions. Understanding the impact of climate change therefore requires understanding how climate-related harms may affect productivity and economic growth. Furthermore, we suggest that misunderstandings about growth assumptions in the model may underlie the debate surrounding the proper discount rate.",1,1667942052, 1485395,Scholarly Journals,,"Moyer, Elisabeth J;Woolley, Mark D;Matteson, Nathan J;Glotter, Michael J;Weisbach, David A",," Moyer, Elisabeth J",, Journal Article, 1537-5366, June 2014,,0047-2530,2, English, English, 401-425,June 2014,Journal of Legal Studies," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,43,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1667942052?accountid=14505," Journal of Legal Studies, vol. 43, no. 2, Part 1 June 2014, pp. 401-25", [URL:http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/loi/jls] Publisher's URL, 401," Environment and Growth (O44) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Growth",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Impacts+on+Economic+Growth+as+Drivers+of+Uncertainty+in+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Journal+of+Legal+Studies&amp;issn=00472530&amp;date=2014-06-01&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=401&amp;au=Moyer%2C+Elisabeth+J%3BWoolley%2C+Mark+D%3BMatteson%2C+Nathan+J%3BGlotter%2C+Michael+J%3BWeisbach%2C+David+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Legal+Studies&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1485395&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
'Where-to-Abate' and 'Where-to-Invest' Flexibility--An Integrated Assessment Analysis of Climate Change,"Within the framework of a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model this paper analyses the impact of trade restrictions on regional rates of return on capital, marginal costs of abatement and optimal climate policy. It will be shown that regional differences both in marginal costs of abatement and in marginal productivity of capital are driven by market imperfection. With restrictions on international trade, the industrialized countries of the North exhibit higher marginal costs of abatement and a lower marginal productivity of capital than the developing nations of the South. Free trade not only in carbon emission rights but also in capital increases conventional welfare but stimulates carbon dioxide emissions to grow--an effect that is not completely offset by efficiency gains in abatement. Nevertheless, depending upon the choice of the discount rate some kind of an insensitivity result is observed.",0,56180861, 0643592,Scholarly Journals,,"Muller-Furstenberger, Georg;Stephan, Gunter",," Muller-Furstenberger, Georg",, Journal Article,, June 2002,,0303-9692,2, English, English, 191-213,June 2002,Schweizerische Zeitschrift fur Volkswirtschaft und Statistik/Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2002,, American Economic Association,138,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56180861?accountid=14505," Schweizerische Zeitschrift fur Volkswirtschaft und Statistik/Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics, vol. 138, no. 2, June 2002, pp. 191-213", [URL:http://www.sjes.ch/published.php] Publisher's URL, 191," Renewable Resources and Conservation: Water (Q25) , Renewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q28) , Abatement , Climate , Policy",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=%27Where-to-Abate%27+and+%27Where-to-Invest%27+Flexibility--An+Integrated+Assessment+Analysis+of+Climate+Change&amp;title=Schweizerische+Zeitschrift+fur+Volkswirtschaft+und+Statistik%2FSwiss+Journal+of+Economics+and+Statistics&amp;issn=03039692&amp;date=2002-06-01&amp;volume=138&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=191&amp;au=Muller-Furstenberger%2C+Georg%3BStephan%2C+Gunter&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Schweizerische+Zeitschrift+fur+Volkswirtschaft+und+Statistik%2FSwiss+Journal+of+Economics+and+Statistics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0643592&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

The Political Economy of a Carbon Price Floor for Power Generation,"The EU carbon price lies well below estimates of the social cost of carbon and ""target-consistent"" carbon prices needed to deliver ambitious targets such as the 40% reduction target for 2030. In light of this, the UK introduced a carbon price floor (CPF) for its electricity sector in 2013 and the new Dutch Government has recently made a similar commitment, while successive French Governments have called for an EU-wide CPF. This paper analyzes the impacts and design of a power-sector CPF, both at the EU and national level, using a political-economy approach. We find a good case for introducing such a price-based instrument into the EU ETS. We suggest that a CPF should be designed to ""top up"" the EUA price to 25-30 Euros/tCO2, rising annually at 3-5% above inflation, at least until 2030. We argue that the new EU Market Stability Reserve enhances the value of a CPF in terms of delivering climate benefits, and discuss the potential for a regional CPF in North-West Europe.

A Rapid Assessment Model for Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon: Further Comment,"In this reply to the comment by Gerlagh, we confirm an error in our estimate of the certainty-equivalent social cost of carbon (SCC) reported in Newbold et al. (2013), and we discuss the underlying conceptual difficulties that arise in conducting a social welfare analysis when preferences are heterogeneous or uncertain. The certainty-equivalent SCC depends crucially on the reference level of per capita consumption used to normalize marginal utility across possible preference parameters, and our estimate of the certainty-equivalent SCC was driven largely by an arbitrary choice of measurement units. All other results from our rapid assessment model are based on the deterministic SCC or its simulated probability distribution, which does not depend on the reference level of per capita consumption.",1,1650521637, 1471786,Scholarly Journals,,"Newbold, Stephen C;Griffiths, Charles;Moore, Chris;Wolverton, Ann;Kopits, Elizabeth",," Newbold, Stephen C",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, May 2014,,2010-0078,2, English, English, 1-6,May 2014,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,5,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1650521637?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 5, no. 2, May 2014, pp. 1-6", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Rapid+Assessment+Model+for+Understanding+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon%3A+Further+Comment&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2014-05-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Newbold%2C+Stephen+C%3BGriffiths%2C+Charles%3BMoore%2C+Chris%3BWolverton%2C+Ann%3BKopits%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1471786&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
A Rapid Assessment Model for Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon,"The ""social cost of carbon"" (SCC) is the present value of the stream of future damages from one additional unit of carbon emissions in a particular year. This paper develops a rapid assessment model for the SCC. The model includes the essential ingredients for calculating the SCC at the global scale and is designed to be transparent and easy to use and modify. Our goal is to provide a tool to help analysts and decision-makers quickly explore the implications of various modeling assumptions for the SCC. We use the model to conduct sensitivity analyses over some of the key input parameters, and we compare estimates of the SCC under certainty and uncertainty in a Monte Carlo analysis. We find that, due to the combined effects of uncertainty and risk aversion, the certainty-equivalent SCC can be substantially larger than the expected value of the SCC. In our Monte Carlo simulation, the certainty-equivalent SCC is more than four times larger than the expected value of the SCC, and we show that this result depends crucially on how the uncertain preference parameters are handled. We also compare the approximate present value of benefits estimated using the SCC to the exact value of compensating variation in the initial period for a wide range of hypothetical emission reduction policies.",1,1373418043, 1372484,Scholarly Journals,,"Newbold, Stephen C;Griffiths, Charles;Moore, Chris;Wolverton, Ann;Kopits, Elizabeth",," Newbold, Stephen C",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, February 2013,,2010-0078,1, English, English, 1-40,February 2013,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,4,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1373418043?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 4, no. 1, February 2013, pp. 1-40", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Rapid+Assessment+Model+for+Understanding+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2013-02-01&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Newbold%2C+Stephen+C%3BGriffiths%2C+Charles%3BMoore%2C+Chris%3BWolverton%2C+Ann%3BKopits%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1372484&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon: Concepts and Results from the DICE-2013R Model and Alternative Approaches,"The social cost of carbon (SCC) is an important concept for understanding and implementing climate change policies. This term represents the economic cost caused by an additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions (or more succinctly carbon) or its equivalent. The present study describes the development of the concept, provides examples of its use in current US regulator policies, examines its analytical background, and estimates the SCC using an updated integrated assessment model, the DICE-2013R model. The study estimates that the SCC is $18.6 per ton of CO2 in 2005 US dollars and international prices for the current period (2015). For the central case, the real SCC grows at 3% per year over the period to 2050.

The Economics of Disintegration of the Greenland Ice Sheet,"Concerns about the impact on large-scale earth systems have taken center stage in the scientific and economic analysis of climate change. The present study analyzes the economic impact of a potential disintegration of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). The method is to combine a small geophysical model of the GIS with the DICE integrated assessment model. The result shows that the GIS is likely to disappear over the next millennium or so without climate policy, but an active climate policy may prevent the GIS from crossing the threshold of irreversibility. Additionally, the study estimates the impact of the GIS on the social cost of carbon (SCC) and finds that adding GIS dynamics would add less than 5% to the SCC under alternative discount rates and estimates of the GIS dynamics. Simulations of geo-engineering options indicate that the dynamics of disintegration and rebuilding are extremely asymmetric, implying that GIS disintegration should be treated as irreversible.",0,2064758354, 1710004,Working Papers,,"Nordhaus, William D"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Nordhaus, William D",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2018",,,, English, English, 42,"0, 2018","Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2130, 2018, 42 pp.", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2018," Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2130"," American Economic Association  Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2130",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2064758354?accountid=14505," Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2130, 2018, 42 pp.", [URL:http://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d21/d2130.pdf] URL, 42," Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Publicly Provided Goods: General (H40) , Climate change, Environment, Ice sheets, DICE model",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Global+Melting%3F+The+Economics+of+Disintegration+of+the+Greenland+Ice+Sheet&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=42&amp;au=Nordhaus%2C+William+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1710004&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

"Evolution of Assessments of the Economics of Global Warming: Changes in the DICE model, 1992-2017","Many areas of the natural and social sciences involve complex systems that link together multiple sectors. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are approaches that integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework, and these are particularly important for climate change. One of the earliest IAMs for climate change was the DICE/RICE family of models, first published in Nordhaus (1992), with the latest version in Nordhaus (2017, 2017a). A difficulty in assessing IAMs is the inability to use standard statistical tests because of the lack of a probabilistic structure. In the absence of statistical tests, the present study examines the extent of revisions of the DICE model over its quarter-century history. The study finds that the major revisions have come primarily from the economic aspects of the model, whereas the environmental changes have been much smaller. Particularly sharp revisions have occurred for global output, damages, and the social cost of carbon. These results indicate that the economic projections are the least precise parts of IAMs and deserve much greater study than has been the case up to now, especially careful studies of long-run economic growth (to 2100 and beyond).",1,1904177821, 1639174,Working Papers,,"Nordhaus, William D"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Nordhaus, William D",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2017",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2017",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2017," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23319"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23319",w23319,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1904177821?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 23319, 2017", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w23319.pdf] URL,," Mathematical Methods, Programming Models, Mathematical and Simulation Modeling: General (C60) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Evolution+of+Assessments+of+the+Economics+of+Global+Warming%3A+Changes+in+the+DICE+model%2C+1992-2017&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=w23319&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nordhaus%2C+William+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1639174&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Projections and uncertainties about climate change in an era of minimal climate policies,"Climate change remains one of the major international environmental challenges facing nations. Yet nations have to date taken minimal policies to slow climate change. Moreover, there has been no major improvement in emissions trends as of the latest data. The current study uses the updated DICE model to present new projections and the impacts of alternative climate policies. It also presents a new set of estimates of the uncertainties about future climate change and compares the results will those of other integrated assessment models. The study confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if there are not major climate-change policies. It suggests that it will be extremely difficult to achieve the 2 degrees C target of international agreements even if ambitious policies are introduced in the near term. The required carbon price needed to achieve current targets has risen over time as policies have been delayed.",1,1883168762, 1628888,Working Papers,,"Nordhaus, William D"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Nordhaus, William D",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2016",,,, English, English, 43,"0, 2016","Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2057, 2016, 43 pp.", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2016," Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2057"," American Economic Association  Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2057",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883168762?accountid=14505," Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 2057, 2016, 43 pp.", [URL:http://cowles.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/pub/d20/d2057.pdf] URL, 43," Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Mathematical Methods, Programming Models, Mathematical and Simulation Modeling: General (C60) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Public Goods (H41) , Climate change, DICE model, Uncertainty, Social cost of carbon",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Projections+and+uncertainties+about+climate+change+in+an+era+of+minimal+climate+policies&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=43&amp;au=Nordhaus%2C+William+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1628888&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon: Background and Results from the RICE-2011 Model,"A new and important concept in global warming economics and policy is the social cost of carbon or SCC. This concept represents the economic cost caused by an additional ton of carbon-dioxide emissions or its equivalent.

Additional concerns are uncertainty about different aspects of global warming as well as the treatment of different countries or generations. The most important results are: First, the estimated social cost of carbon for the current time (2015) including uncertainty, equity weighting, and risk aversion is $44 per ton of carbon (or $12 per ton CO2) in 2005 US$ and international prices). Second, including uncertainty increases the expected value of the SCC by approximately 8 percent. Third, equity weighting generally tends to reduce the SCC.

Integrated Economic and Climate Modeling,"This survey examines the history and current practice in integrated assessment models (IAMs) of the economics of climate change. It begins with a review of the emerging problem of climate change. The next section provides a brief sketch of the rise of IAMs in the 1970s and beyond. The subsequent section is an extended exposition of one IAM, the DICE/RICE family of models. The purpose of this description is to provide readers an example of how such a model is developed and what the major components are. The final section discusses major important open questions that continue to occupy IAM modelers. These involve issues such as the discount rate, uncertainty, the social cost of carbon, the potential for catastrophic climate change, algorithms, and fat-tailed distributions. These issues are ones that pose both deep intellectual challenges as well as important policy implications for climate change and climate-change policy.",1,913431029, 1269179,Working Papers,,"Nordhaus, William D"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Nordhaus, William D",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2011",,,, English, English, 99,"0, 2011","Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1839, 2011, 99 pp.", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2011," Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1839"," American Economic Association  Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1839",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/913431029?accountid=14505," Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1839, 2011, 99 pp.", [URL:http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d18a/d1839.pdf] URL, 99," Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Mathematical Methods, Programming Models, Mathematical and Simulation Modeling: General (C60) , Publicly Provided Goods: General (H40) , Climate change, Integrated assessment models, Environmental economics, Social cost of carbon, Large-scale mathematical models",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Integrated+Economic+and+Climate+Modeling&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=99&amp;au=Nordhaus%2C+William+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1269179&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Alternative Policies and Sea-Level Rise in the RICE-2009 Model,"The present study extends earlier research by presenting the results of a new and updated version of the RICE model (Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy), labeled the RICE-2009 model. The model is a regionalized, dynamic model that incorporates an end-to-end treatment of economic growth, emissions, climate change, damages, and emissions controls. The model allows projections of what will occur with no policies, with efficient policies be, how nations can undertake policies to limit climate change (in the current runs to 2 degrees C), and the impacts of limited participation. These new estimates indicate that coordinated international policies have a substantial economic benefit. The optimal carbon tax is estimated to be $29 per ton carbon ($8 per ton CO_2) for 2010 in 2005 prices. The economic optimum would limit global temperature rise to an average of 2.5 degrees C over 1900 levels for the 22nd and 23rd century.",0,56954140, 1061285,Working Papers,,"Nordhaus, William D"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Nordhaus, William D",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2009",,,, English, English, 23,"0, 2009","Cowles Foundation, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1716, 2009, 23 pp.", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2009," Cowles Foundation, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1716"," American Economic Association  Cowles Foundation, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1716",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56954140?accountid=14505," Cowles Foundation, Yale University, Cowles Foundation Discussion Papers: 1716, 2009, 23 pp.", [URL:http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d17a/d1716.pdf] URL, 23," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Economic Growth and Aggregate Productivity: General (O40) , Climate change economics, Environmental policy, Economic growth",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Alternative+Policies+and+Sea-Level+Rise+in+the+RICE-2009+Model&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=23&amp;au=Nordhaus%2C+William+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1061285&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Discounting the Future: on Climate Change, Ambiguity Aversion and Epstein-Zin Preferences","We focus on the effect of preference specifications on the current day valuation of future outcomes. Specifically, we analyze the effect of risk aversion, ambiguity aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution on the willingness to pay to avoid climate change risk. The first part of the paper analyzes a general disaster (jump) risk model with a constant arrival rate of disasters. This provides useful intuition in how preferences influence valuation of long-term risk. The second part of the paper extends this model with a climate model and a temperature dependent arrival rate. Since the model yields closed form solutions up to solving an integral, our model does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality of numerical IAMs with several state variables.

Households and heat stress: estimating the distributional consequences of climate change,"Recent economic research documents a range of adverse welfare consequences from extreme heat stress, including health, labor productivity, and direct consumption disutility impacts. Without rapid adaptation, climate change will increase the burden of heat stress experienced by much of the world's population in the coming decades. What will the distributional consequences of this added heat stress be, and how might this affect optimal climate policy? Using detailed survey data of household wealth in 690,745 households across 52 countries, this paper finds evidence suggesting that the welfare impacts of added heat stress caused by climate change may be regressive. Specifically, the analysis finds that poorer households tend to be located in hotter locations across and within countries, and poorer individuals are more likely to work in occupations with greater exposure to the elements not only across but also within countries. These findings--combined with the fact that current social cost of carbon estimates do not include climate damages arising from the productivity impacts of heat stress--suggest that optimal climate policy, especially when allowing for declining marginal utility of consumption, involves more stringent abatement than currently suggested, and that redistributive adaptation policies may be required to reduce the mechanical inequities in welfare impacts arising from climate change.",0,1738000270, 1531771,Working Papers,,"Park, Jisung;Hallegatte, Stephane;Bangalore, Mook;Sandhoefner, Evan"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Park, Jisung",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2015",,,, English, English,,"0, 2015","The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 7479, 2015", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2015," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 7479"," American Economic Association  The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 7479",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1738000270?accountid=14505," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 7479, 2015", [URL:http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/11/05/090224b083197124/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Households0and0es0of0climate0ch ange.pdf] URL,,,https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Households+and+heat+stress%3A+estimating+the+distributional+consequences+of+climate+change&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Park%2C+Jisung%3BHallegatte%2C+Stephane%3BBangalore%2C+Mook%3BSandhoefner%2C+Evan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1531771&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Taxing Electricity Sector Carbon Emissions at Social Cost,"Concerns about budget deficits, tax reform, and climate change are fueling discussions about taxing carbon emissions to generate revenue and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Imposing a carbon tax on electricity production based on the social cost of carbon (SCC) could generate between $21 and $82 billion in revenues in 2020 and would have important effects on electricity markets. The sources of emissions reductions in the sector depend on the level of the tax. A carbon tax based on lower SCC estimates reduces emissions by reducing demand and through the substitution of gas for coal, whereas taxes based on higher SCC estimates induce switching to wind and nuclear generation. The slow rate of growth of the SCC estimates means that any SCC-based carbon tax trajectory provides weaker long-run incentives for expanded renewable and nuclear generation than a cap-and-trade program that achieves an equivalent level of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions reductions. Taxing carbon at the SCC is welfare enhancing, but the SCC may not be the optimal tax rate.

The Social Cost of Carbon and Its Policy Implications,"The shadow price, or ""social cost"", of carbon is an important indicator of the global incremental damage done by emitting greenhouse gases today. Cost-benefit analysis would set the optimal amount of greenhouse-gas-emission reduction at the point where this social cost just equals the incremental cost of controlling emissions. The higher the value for the social cost of carbon, the more control is warranted. This comparison assumes that cost-benefit analysis is the correct way of determining climate-change policy, and many believe this is not the case because of the very long-term, irreversible, and potentially catastrophic nature of global warming. But, in the short run at least, a comparison of cost and benefits is required, and, in any event, all decisions imply costs and benefits. But what is the ""right"" figure for the social cost of carbon? This paper reviews the UK government's assessment of the cost and concludes that it has been set far too high because of a misreading of the integrated assessment models used to balance costs and benefits. Moreover, adoption of the UK government's shadow price would have formidable implications for energy policy in the UK, and for policies on afforestation.",0,56450907, 0758156,Scholarly Journals,,"Pearce, David",," Pearce, David",, Journal Article, 1460-2121, October 2003,,0266-903X,3, English, English, 362-384,October 2003,Oxford Review of Economic Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2003,, American Economic Association,19,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56450907?accountid=14505," Oxford Review of Economic Policy, vol. 19, no. 3, Autumn 2003, pp. 362-84", [URL:https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/issue] Publisher's URL, 362," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.K. , Europe",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+and+Its+Policy+Implications&amp;title=Oxford+Review+of+Economic+Policy&amp;issn=0266903X&amp;date=2003-10-01&amp;volume=19&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=362&amp;au=Pearce%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Oxford+Review+of+Economic+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0758156&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
What Social Cost of Carbon? A Mapping of the Climate Debate,"Given disparate beliefs about economic growth, technical change and damage caused by climate change, this paper starts with the seeming impossibility of determining a unique time profile of the social costs of carbon as a benchmark for climate negotiations and for infrastructure decisions that need to be made now in the absence of an inclusive international accord on climate policies. The paper demonstrates that determining a workable range of the social costs of carbon is however possible in a sequential decision-making framework that permits revising initial decisions in the light of new information. To do so, the paper exploits the results of a stochastic optimal control model run for more than 2000 scenarios that represent the set of beliefs presented about key uncertain parameters in the literature. The paper provides a heuristic mapping of the climate debate in the form of six ""clubs of opinions"" and shows the possibility of determining a range of social costs of carbon that might permit a compromise between the maximum range of ""clubs"" and those most likely to emerge in the future.",0,1030500890, 1311061,Working Papers,,"Perrissin Fabert, Baptiste;Dumas, Patrice;Hourcade, Jean-Charles"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Perrissin Fabert, Baptiste",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2012",,,, English, English,,"0, 2012","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.34, 2012", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2012," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.34"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.34",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030500890?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2012.34, 2012", [URL:http://www.feem.it/userfiles/attach/2012522161784NDL2012-034.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Renewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q21) , Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Optimal control, Mitigation, Social Cost of Carbon, Uncertainty",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=What+Social+Cost+of+Carbon%3F+A+Mapping+of+the+Climate+Debate&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perrissin+Fabert%2C+Baptiste%3BDumas%2C+Patrice%3BHourcade%2C+Jean-Charles&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1311061&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Comparative Impact of Integrated Assessment Models' Structures on Optimal Mitigation Policies,"This paper aims at providing a consistent framework to appraise alternative modeling choices that have driven the so-called ""when flexibility"" controversy since the early 1990s dealing with the optimal timing of mitigation efforts and the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The literature has emphasized the critical impact of modeling structures on the optimal climate policy. But, to our knowledge, there has been no contribution trying to estimate the comparative impact of modeling structures within a unified framework. In this paper, we use the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) RESPONSE to bridge this gap and investigate the structural modeling drivers of differences in climate policy recommendations. RESPONSE is both sufficiently compact to be easily tractable and detailed enough to capture a wide array of modeling choices. Here, we restrict the analysis to the following emblematic modeling choices: the forms of the damage function (quadratic vs. sigmoid) and the abatement cost (with or without inertia), the treatment of uncertainty, and the decision framework (one-shot vs. sequential). We define an original methodology based on an equivalence criterion to carry out a sensitivity analysis over modeling structures in order to estimate their relative impact on two output variables: the optimal SCC and abatement trajectories. This allows us to exhibit three key findings: (i) IAMs with a quadratic damage function are insensitive to changes of other features of the modeling structure, (ii) IAMs involving a non-convex damage function entail contrasting climate strategies, (iii) Precautionary behaviours can only come up in IAMs with non-convexities in damages.",0,1566813357, 1456923,Working Papers,,"Perrissin Fabert, Baptiste;Espagne, Etienne;Pottier, Antonin;Dumas, Patrice"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Perrissin Fabert, Baptiste",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.58, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.58"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.58",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1566813357?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.58, 2014", [URL:http://www.feem.it/userfiles/attach/201471113154NDL2014-058.pdf] URL,," Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Integrated Assessment Models, Mitigation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Comparative+Impact+of+Integrated+Assessment+Models%27+Structures+on+Optimal+Mitigation+Policies&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perrissin+Fabert%2C+Baptiste%3BEspagne%2C+Etienne%3BPottier%2C+Antonin%3BDumas%2C+Patrice&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1456923&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Carbon Tax Pricing and the Social Cost of Carbon: The Case in the South African Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Industry,"Since the implementation of carbon tax on motor vehicles in South Africa during 2010, the pricing of the tax has never been challenged or assessed. The purpose of this study is to gauge the reasonability of the carbon tax price in South Africa as applicable to the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. A detailed review is performed to determine the adequacy of the carbon tax price by comparing the social cost of carbon from motor vehicle emissions against the revenue raised from carbon tax levied on motor vehicles in the same period. Empirical research includes an exploratory questionnaire into the adequacy of the carbon tax price in South Africa with input data from multinational motor vehicle manufacturers operating in South Africa. The findings from the literature review confirm that although the respondents do not consider the level of carbon tax price as adequate to be relevant for the social cost of carbon, the revenue raised from this tax exceeds the social cost of carbon leading to the conclusion that the tax is adequately priced.",1,1504126004, 1417355,Scholarly Journals,,"Pillay, Suren;Buys, Pieter W",," Pillay, Suren",, Journal Article, 2157-8834, November 2013,,0892-7626,6, English, English, 1751-1761,November 2013,Journal of Applied Business Research," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2013,, American Economic Association,29,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1504126004?accountid=14505," Journal of Applied Business Research, vol. 29, no. 6, November-December 2013, pp. 1751-61", [URL:http://journals.cluteonline.com/index.php/JABR/issue/archive] Publisher's URL, 1751," Economics of Regulation (L51) , Automobiles, Other Transportation Equipment, Related Parts and Equipment (L62) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , South Africa , Africa , Manufacturing , Motor Vehicle , Vehicles",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Carbon+Tax+Pricing+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon%3A+The+Case+in+the+South+African+Motor+Vehicle+Manufacturing+Industry&amp;title=Journal+of+Applied+Business+Research&amp;issn=08927626&amp;date=2013-11-01&amp;volume=29&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1751&amp;au=Pillay%2C+Suren%3BBuys%2C+Pieter+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Applied+Business+Research&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1417355&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Coase Lecture--Taxes, Targets and the Social Cost of Carbon","In environmental economics, the marginal external cost of emitting a pollutant determines the optimal abatement policy, which might take the form of an emissions tax. But the marginal external cost is often difficult to estimate. This is especially the case when it comes to climate change; estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) range from around $10 per metric ton to well over $200 per metric ton, and there has been little or no movement toward a consensus number. Partly as a result, rather than an SCC-based carbon tax, climate policy has focused on a set of targets that would put limits on temperature increases or atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which in turn imply targets for emission reductions. Economics, however, can tell us little about whether such targets are socially optimal. I discuss the trade-off between taxes versus targets as the focus of policy, explain why it has been so difficult to estimate a marginal SCC, and suggest an approach to estimating an average SCC through the use of expert elicitation. I argue that such an approach could serve as the basis for a harmonized carbon tax.",1,1999335392, 1669322,Scholarly Journals,,"Pindyck, Robert S",," Pindyck, Robert S",, Journal Article, 1468-0335, July 2017,,0013-0427,335, English, English, 345-364,July 2017,Economica," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,84,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1999335392?accountid=14505," Economica, vol. 84, no. 335, July 2017, pp. 345-64", [URL:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291468-0335/issues] Publisher's URL, 345," Organizational Behavior, Transaction Costs, Property Rights (D23) , Asymmetric and Private Information, Mechanism Design (D82) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Cost , Environmental Economics , Tax , Taxes",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Coase+Lecture--Taxes%2C+Targets+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Economica&amp;issn=00130427&amp;date=2017-07-01&amp;volume=84&amp;issue=335&amp;spage=345&amp;au=Pindyck%2C+Robert+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economica&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1669322&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Social Cost of Carbon Revisited,"An estimate of the social cost of carbon (SCC) is key to climate policy. But how should we estimate the SCC? A common approach is to use an integrated assessment model (IAM) to simulate time paths for the atmospheric CO2 concentration, its impact on global mean temperature, and the resulting reductions in GDP and consumption. I have argued that IAMs have serious deficiencies that make them poorly suited for this job, but what is the alternative? I present a more transparent approach to estimating an average SCC, which I argue is a more useful guide for policy than the marginal SCC derived from IAMs. I rely on a survey through which I elicit expert opinions regarding (1) the probabilities of alternative economic outcomes of climate change, including extreme outcomes such as a 20% or greater reduction in GDP, but not the particular causes of those outcomes; and (2) the reduction in emissions required to avert an extreme outcome. My estimate of the average SCC is the ratio of the present value of damages from an extreme outcome to the total emission reduction needed to avert such an outcome. I discuss the survey instrument, explain how experts were identified, and present results. I obtain SCC estimates of $200/mt or higher, but the variation across experts is large. Trimming outliers and focusing on experts who expressed a high degree of confidence in their answers yields lower SCCs, $80 to $100/mt.",1,1850757628, 1606005,Working Papers,,"Pindyck, Robert S"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Pindyck, Robert S",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2016",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2016",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2016," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22807"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22807",w22807,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1850757628?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 22807, 2016", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w22807.pdf] URL,," Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+Revisited&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=w22807&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pindyck%2C+Robert+S&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1606005&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Climate Change Policy: What Do the Models Tell Us?,"Very little. A plethora of integrated assessment models (IAMs) have been constructed and used to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC) and evaluate alternative abatement policies. These models have crucial flaws that make them close to useless as tools for policy analysis: certain inputs (e.g. the discount rate) are arbitrary, but have huge effects on the SCC estimates the models produce; the models' descriptions of the impact of climate change are completely ad hoc, with no theoretical or empirical foundation; and the models can tell us nothing about the most important driver of the SCC, the possibility of a catastrophic climate outcome.

"Three Essays in Energy, Environmental and Public Economics","This work comprises three investigations in energy, environmental and public economics: (1) estimation of tax evasion and subsidy pass-through under the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), (2) estimation of increased uptake of residential PV systems in response to the California Solar Initiative (CSI) cash rebate program, and (3) estimation of the increase in ambient ozone levels due to a cost-saving condensed work week program for state employees in Salt Lake City, Utah. The first chapter hypothesizes that firms in the third party PV industry over-report prices in order to unfairly exploit tax benefits increasing in price under the federal ITC program. I estimate the degree of price over-reporting in the third party PV industry in California under the 30% ITC tax break program by observing firms simultaneously operating in the customer owned and third party PV markets to estimate a within firm, within solar module fixed effects model of the premium firms report for third party prices. I find that on average firms inflate reported prices by 10%, or $3,900 per system, leading to $25 million in tax evasion under the ITC in California between 2007 and 2011. Secondly, I exploit exogenous variation in benefits under the ITC stemming from lifting of the $2,000 cap in 2009 to estimate a difference-in-differences model of subsidy incidence under the ITC in the customer owned PV market. I find that consumers realize only a small portion of ITC benefits, with 83% passed through to firms. The second chapter, written with Jonathan Hughes, explores the role of the upfront cash rebate program for PV under the CSI, exploiting variation in rebate levels stemming from a ratcheting-down rebate structure that decreases independently in California's two largest utilities, PG&E and SCE. To minimize the endogeneity of rebate decreases, we exploit the boundary region between SCE and PG&E in estimating a geographic discontinuity based fixed effects model of the effects of rebate rates on solar adoptions. We find that a 10% increase in the rebate rate has a large positive effect on adoptions, increasing the uptake rate by 14% at the mean, and that overall 58% fewer installations would have occurred in the absence of the CSI rebate program. We find the program to be very costly--in terms of CO2 reductions, we calculate average abatement costs under the program to be between $54 and $57 per metric ton of carbon dioxide avoided, compared with the currently accepted central estimate of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) of $26 per metric ton. The final chapter explores the unintended air quality consequences of a condensed work week policy for public employees in Utah's Salt Lake City metro area, moving employees to a 4-day work week, which was intended to reduce operating costs in state agencies. Using a regression discontinuity approach around the time when the policy was instated, I find that the policy had the perverse effect of increasing levels of ambient ozone. Due to the unusual back-bending ozone production curve and the VOC-constrained environment in SLC, small reductions in NOx, an exhaust bi-product, due to decreased vehicular traffic, actually increase production of ambient ozone, worsening smog conditions.",0,1640478372, 1470944,Dissertations & Theses,,"Podolefsky, Molly",," Podolefsky, Molly",, Dissertation,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","University of Colorado, 2013", CSAPTdissertations,2013, University of Colorado, American Economic Association  University of Colorado,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1640478372?accountid=14505," University of Colorado, 2013",,," Personal Income and Other Nonbusiness Taxes and Subsidies, includes inheritance and gift taxes (H24) , Business Taxes and Subsidies including sales and value-added (VAT) (H25) , Tax Evasion and Avoidance (H26) , Electric Utilities (L94) , Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise, Hazardous Waste, Solid Waste, Recycling (Q53) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Air Quality , Energy , Environment , Evasion , Public Economics , Subsidy , Tax , Tax Benefit , Tax Evasion",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:EconLit&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+Essays+in+Energy%2C+Environmental+and+Public+Economics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Podolefsky%2C+Molly&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1470944&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
How expensive should CO2 be? Fuel for the debate on optimal climate policy,Most people are convinced that climate change is a threat and that it should somehow be dealt with. It is also clear that CO2 emissions are still too cheap and must be priced higher to sufficiently curtail emissions. Yet how high should a carbon tax be? Answering this question requires scientific insights on the costs and benefits of a carbon tax but also ethical--and thus political--judgements on how we value the damages from climate change that will happen in the near and in the far future. This paper reviews the evidence on the social cost of carbon and discusses global and unilateral policy options. It finds that a price of $77 per metric ton of carbon is defensible if we give 95% weight to damages occurring two generations (or 50 years) from now but higher if we want to further reduce the risk of catastrophic change. It is best implemented as part of trade agreements and in combination with R&D investment.,1,1983776853, 1678854,Working Papers,,"Poelhekke, Steven"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Poelhekke, Steven",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2017",,,, English, English,,"0, 2017","Netherlands Central Bank, Research Department, DNB Working Papers, 2017", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2017," Netherlands Central Bank, Research Department, DNB Working Papers"," American Economic Association  Netherlands Central Bank, Research Department, DNB Working Papers",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1983776853?accountid=14505," Netherlands Central Bank, Research Department, DNB Working Papers, 2017", [URL:https://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/Working%20Paper%20No.%20579_tcm47-369464.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue: General (H20) , Environment and Growth (O44) , climate change , carbon tax , discounting , policy",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=How+expensive+should+CO2+be%3F+Fuel+for+the+debate+on+optimal+climate+policy&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Poelhekke%2C+Steven&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1678854&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming,"Despite growing empirical evidence of the link between environmental policy and innovation, most economic models of environmental policy treat technology as exogenous. For long-term problems such as climate change, this omission can be significant. In this paper, I modify the DICE model of climate change (Nordhaus 1994, Nordhaus and Boyer 2000) to allow for induced innovation in the energy sector. Ignoring induced technological change overstates the welfare costs of an optimal carbon tax policy by 8.3 percent. However, cost-savings, rather than increased environmental benefits, appear to drive the welfare gains, as the effect of induced innovation on emissions and mean global temperature is small. Sensitivity analysis shows that potential crowding out of other R&D and market failures in the R&D sector are the most important limiting factors to the potential of induced innovation. Differences in these key assumptions explain much of the variation in the findings of other similar models.",1,56335794, 0714378,Working Papers,,"Popp, David"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href =""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Popp, David",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2003",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2003",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2003," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 9762"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 9762",w9762,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56335794?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 9762, 2003", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w9762.pdf] URL,," Technological Change: Choices and Consequences, Diffusion Processes (O33) , One, Two, and Multisector Growth Models (O41)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=ENTICE%3A+Endogenous+Technological+Change+in+the+DICE+Model+of+Global+Warming&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2003-01-01&amp;volume=w9762&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Popp%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0714378&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
A Tale of Tails: Uncertainty and the Social Cost of Carbon Dioxide,"Recent thinking about the economics of climate change has concerned the uncertainty about the upper bound of both climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and the damages that might occur at high temperatures. This argument suggests that the appropriate probability distributions for these factors may be fat-tailed. The matter of tail shape has important implications for the calculation of the social cost of carbon dioxide (SCCO2). In this paper, a probabilistic integrated assessment model is adapted to allow for the possibility of a thin, intermediate or fat tail for both (i) the climate sensitivity parameter and (ii) the damage function exponent. Results show that depending on the tail shape of the climate sensitivity parameter the mean SCCO2 rises by 2985%. Changes in the mean SCCO2 due to the adjustments to the damage function alone range from a reduction of 7% to a rise of 12%. The combination of both leads to rises of 3,315%. Greater rises occur for the upper percentiles of the SCCO2 estimates. Given the uncertainties in both the science and the economics of climate change different tail shapes deserve consideration due to their important implications for the range of possible values for the SCCO2.",0,925698604, 1281575,Scholarly Journals,,"Pycroft, Jonathan;Vergano, Lucia;Hope, Chris;Paci, Daniele;Ciscar, Juan Carlos",," Pycroft, Jonathan",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2011",,1864-6042,, English, English,,"0, 2011","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2011,, American Economic Association,5,https://search.proquest.com/docview/925698604?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 5, 2011", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL,," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Global , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Tale+of+Tails%3A+Uncertainty+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+Dioxide&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pycroft%2C+Jonathan%3BVergano%2C+Lucia%3BHope%2C+Chris%3BPaci%2C+Daniele%3BCiscar%2C+Juan+Carlos&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1281575&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Importance of 'Extremely Unlikely' Events: Tail Risk and the Costs of Climate Change,"In assessing the risks associated with climate change, 'tail risks' (low-probability extreme events) often play a much larger role than their probability alone might indicate. There are three main reasons for this: the linear relationship between sensitivity and warming; the convexity of the damage function; and the concavity of the utility function. Ignoring the upper tail of the distribution of possible outcomes will result in serious underestimates of the social cost of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and of the socially optimal price for emissions.",1,2034285654, 1699633,Scholarly Journals,,"Quiggin, John",," Quiggin, John",, Journal Article, 1467-8489, January 2018,,1364-985X,1, English, English, 4-20,January 2018,Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,62,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2034285654?accountid=14505," Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, vol. 62, no. 1, January 2018, pp. 4-20", [URL:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291467-8489/issues] Publisher's URL, 4," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Importance+of+%27Extremely+Unlikely%27+Events%3A+Tail+Risk+and+the+Costs+of+Climate+Change&amp;title=Australian+Journal+of+Agricultural+and+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=1364985X&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=62&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=4&amp;au=Quiggin%2C+John&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Australian+Journal+of+Agricultural+and+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1699633&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Carbon Capture Retrofits and the Cost of Regulatory Uncertainty,"Power generation firms confront impending replacement of an aging coal-fired fleet in a business environment characterized by volatile natural gas prices and uncertain carbon regulation. We develop a stochastic dynamic programming model of firm investment decisions that minimizes the expected present value of future power generation costs under uncertain natural gas and carbon prices. We explore the implications of regulatory uncertainty on generation technology choice and the optimal timing of investment, and assess the implications of these choices for regulators. We find that interaction of regulatory uncertainty with irreversible investment always raises the social cost of carbon abatement. Further, the social cost of regulatory uncertainty is strongly dependent on the relative competitiveness of IGCC plants, for which the cost of later carbon capture retrofits is comparatively small, and on the firms ability to use investments in natural gas generation as a transitional strategy to manage carbon regulation uncertainty. Without highly competitive IGCC or low gas prices, regulatory uncertainty can increase the expected social cost of reducing emissions by 40 to 60%.",1,56621654, 0936614,Scholarly Journals,,"Reinelt, Peter S;Keith, David W",," Reinelt, Peter S",, Journal Article, 1944-9089,"  0, 2007",,0195-6574,4, English, English, 101-127,"0, 2007",Energy Journal," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2007,, American Economic Association,28,https://search.proquest.com/docview/56621654?accountid=14505," Energy Journal, vol. 28, no. 4, 2007, pp. 101-27", [URL:http://www.iaee.org/en/publications/journal.aspx] Publisher's URL, 101," Capital Budgeting, Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies, Capacity (G31) , Economics of Regulation (L51) , Electric Utilities (L94) , Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy (L98) , Technological Change: Choices and Consequences, Diffusion Processes (O33) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Environment , Firm Investment , Firm , Gas , Investment , Natural Gas , Regulation , Technology",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Carbon+Capture+Retrofits+and+the+Cost+of+Regulatory+Uncertainty&amp;title=Energy+Journal&amp;issn=01956574&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=101&amp;au=Reinelt%2C+Peter+S%3BKeith%2C+David+W&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0936614&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

The Opportunity Cost of Climate Policy: A Question of Reference,"The cost of climate policy depends on the no-policy alternative without which the ""opportunity cost"" of climate action cannot be determined. This baseline path has to reflect the current failure in the market for carbon emissions. Because of a negative externality, private investment decisions are made without considering the climate damage they entail. Agents overinvest in conventional capital and underinvest in climate capital. Internalization of climate damage lowers the private return to capital, and agents reduce investment in favor of mitigation and consumption. Optimal climate policy increases the welfare of both the present and the future. A simulation of the inefficient no-policy scenario in the Dynamic integrated climate-economy model (DICE-07) confirms this numerically.",1,925696672, 1283555,Scholarly Journals,,"Rezai, Armon",," Rezai, Armon",, Journal Article, 1467-9442, December 2011,,0347-0520,4, English, English, 885-903,December 2011,Scandinavian Journal of Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2011,, American Economic Association,113,https://search.proquest.com/docview/925696672?accountid=14505," Scandinavian Journal of Economics, vol. 113, no. 4, December 2011, pp. 885-903", [URL:http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291467-9442/issues] Publisher's URL, 885," Externalities (D62) , Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement (D63) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Externality , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Opportunity+Cost+of+Climate+Policy%3A+A+Question+of+Reference&amp;title=Scandinavian+Journal+of+Economics&amp;issn=03470520&amp;date=2011-12-01&amp;volume=113&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=885&amp;au=Rezai%2C+Armon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Scandinavian+Journal+of+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1283555&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Climate Policies under Climate Model Uncertainty: Max-Min and Min-Max Regret,"Temperature responses and optimal climate policies depend crucially on the choice of a particular climate model. To illustrate, the temperature responses to given emission reduction paths implied by the climate modules of the well-known integrated assessments models DICE, FUND and PAGE are described and compared. A dummy temperature module based on the climate denialists' view is added. Using a simple welfare-maximising growth model of the global economy, the sensitivity of the optimal carbon price, renewable energy subsidy and energy transition to each of these climate models is discussed. The paper then derives max-min, max-max and min-max regret policies to deal with this particular form of climate (model) uncertainty and with climate scepticism. The max-min or min-max regret climate policies rely on a non-sceptic view of global warming and lead to a substantial and moderate amount of caution, respectively. The max-max leads to no climate policies in line with the view of climate sceptics.",1,1958565051, 1667536,Working Papers,,"Rezai, Armon;der Ploeg, Rick van"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Rezai, Armon",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2017",,,, English, English,,"0, 2017","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6626, 2017", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2017," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6626"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6626",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1958565051?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 6626, 2017", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp6626.pdf] URL,," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , carbon price, renewable energy subsidy, temperature modules, climate model uncertainty, climate sceptics, max-min, max-max, min-max regret",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Policies+under+Climate+Model+Uncertainty%3A+Max-Min+and+Min-Max+Regret&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2017-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rezai%2C+Armon%3Bder+Ploeg%2C+Rick+van&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1667536&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
"Intergenerational Inequality Aversion, Growth, and the Role of Damages: Occam's Rule for the Global Carbon Tax","We derive a simple rule for a nearly optimal carbon tax that can be implemented and tested in a decentralized market economy. Our simple rule depends on the effect of the pure rate of time preference, growth, and intergenerational inequality aversion and basic parameters of the carbon cycle, but also on any adverse effects of global warming on economic growth and mean reversion in climate damages. The performance of the simple rule is excellent and yields only negligible welfare losses compared with the true welfare optimum under a wide range of perturbations including some extreme runs designed to severely road test the rule. Our IAM allows for scarce fossil fuel and endogenous energy transitions and generates cumulative carbon emissions and stranded assets which are also well predicted by our rule.",1,1958559058, 1665790,Scholarly Journals,,"Rezai, Armon;Van der Ploeg, Frederick",," Rezai, Armon",, Journal Article, 2333-5963, June 2016,,2333-5955,2, English, English, 493-522,June 2016,Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,3,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1958559058?accountid=14505," Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, vol. 3, no. 2, June 2016, pp. 493-522", [URL:http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/loi/jaere] Publisher's URL, 493," Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement (D63) , Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , International Fiscal Issues, International Public Goods (H87) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Inequality , Tax , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Intergenerational+Inequality+Aversion%2C+Growth%2C+and+the+Role+of+Damages%3A+Occam%27s+Rule+for+the+Global+Carbon+Tax&amp;title=Journal+of+the+Association+of+Environmental+and+Resource+Economists&amp;issn=23335955&amp;date=2016-06-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=493&amp;au=Rezai%2C+Armon%3BVan+der+Ploeg%2C+Frederick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+the+Association+of+Environmental+and+Resource+Economists&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1665790&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Abandoning Fossil Fuel: How Fast And How Much?,"Climate change must deal with two market failures, global warming and learning by doing in renewable use. The social optimum requires an aggressive renewables subsidy in the near term and a gradually rising carbon tax which falls in long run. As a result, more renewables are used relative to fossil fuel, there is an intermediate phase of simultaneous use, the carbonfree era is brought forward, more fossil fuel is locked up and global warming is lower. The optimal carbon tax is not a fixed proportion of world GDP.

Robustness of a Simple Rule for the Social Cost of Carbon,"The optimal social cost of carbon is in general equilibrium proportional to GDP if utility is logarithmic, production is Cobb-Douglas, depreciation in 100% every period, climate damages as fraction of production decline exponentially with the stock of atmospheric carbon, and fossil fuel extraction does not require capital. The time profile and size of the optimal carbon tax corresponding to this simple formula are not robust to more convex climate damages, smaller elasticities of factor substitution and varying coefficients of relative intergenerational inequality aversion. The optimal timing of energy transitions and the amount of fossil fuel reserves to be locked up in the earth are also not well predicted by this framework. Still, in terms of welfare and global warming the simple formula manages to get quite close to the first best.",1,1531426791, 1438867,Working Papers,,"Rezai, Armon;Van der Ploeg, Rick"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Rezai, Armon",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4703, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4703"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4703",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1531426791?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4703, 2014", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2014/wp-cesifo-2014-03/cesifo1_wp4703. pdf] URL,," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , social cost of carbon, Ramsey growth, climate damages, energy transitions, stranded fossil, fuel assets, robustness",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Robustness+of+a+Simple+Rule+for+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rezai%2C+Armon%3BVan+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1438867&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon: A Model Diagnostic and Inter-comparison Study,"The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a monetary estimate of global climate change damages to society from an additional unit of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. SCCs are used to estimate the benefits of CO2 reductions from policies. However, little is known about the modeling underlying the values or the implied societal risks, making SCC estimates difficult to interpret and assess. This study performs the first in-depth examination of SCC modeling using controlled diagnostic experiments that yield detailed intermediate results, allow for direct comparison of individual components of the models, and facilitate evaluation of the individual model SCCs. Specifically, we analyze DICE, FUND, and PAGE and the multimodel approach used by the US Government. Through our component assessments, we trace SCC differences back to intermediate variables and specific features. We find significant variation in component-level behavior between models driven by model-specific structural and implementation elements, some resulting in artificial differences in results. These elements combine to produce model-specific tendencies in climate and damage responses that contribute to differences observed in SCC outcomes--producing PAGE SCC distributions with longer and fatter right tails and higher averages, followed by DICE with more compact distributions and lower averages, and FUND with distributions that include net benefits and the lowest averages. Overall, our analyses reveal fundamental model behavior relevant to many disciplines of climate research, and identify issues with the models, as well as the overall multimodel approach, that need further consideration. With the growing prominence of SCCs in decision-making, ranging from the local-level to international, improved transparency and technical understanding is essential for informed decisions.",1,1958565613, 1663794,Scholarly Journals,,"Rose, Steven K;Diaz, Delavane B;Blanford, Geoffrey J",," Rose, Steven K",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, May 2017,,2010-0078,2, English, English, 1-28,May 2017,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,8,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1958565613?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 8, no. 2, May 2017, pp. 1-28", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Understanding+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon%3A+A+Model+Diagnostic+and+Inter-comparison+Study&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2017-05-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Rose%2C+Steven+K%3BDiaz%2C+Delavane+B%3BBlanford%2C+Geoffrey+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1663794&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Emissions Trading with Offset Markets and Free Quota Allocations,"We study optimal climate policy for a ""policy bloc"" of countries facing a market where emissions offsets can be purchased from a non-policy ""fringe"" of countries (such as for the CDM). Policy-bloc firms benefit from free quota allocations whose quantity is updated according to firms' past emissions, or their outputs. We show that the resulting abatement and its allocation between policy bloc and fringe are both inefficient. When firms buy offsets directly from the fringe and all quotas are traded at a single price, the policy bloc chooses to either not constrain the offset market, or ban offsets completely. The former (latter) case occurs when free allocation of quotas is not (very) generous, and the offset market is large (small). It is preferable for policy-bloc countries' governments to instead buy offsets directly from the fringe at a quota price below marginal damage cost of emissions, while the policy-bloc quota price will be above this cost. With maximization of global welfare and a unified quota price, this price is higher, and offsets constrained in fewer cases, but the solution still inefficient. Full efficiency then requires a higher quota price in the policy bloc than in the fringe.",1,1511800387, 1425565,Working Papers,,"Rosendahl, Knut Einar;Strand, Jon"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Rosendahl, Knut Einar",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4603, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4603"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4603",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1511800387?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 4603, 2014", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2014/wp-cesifo-2014-01/cesifo1_wp4603. pdf] URL,," Economic Impacts of Globalization: Environment (F64) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , emissions quotas, offset market, quota allocation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Emissions+Trading+with+Offset+Markets+and+Free+Quota+Allocations&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rosendahl%2C+Knut+Einar%3BStrand%2C+Jon&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1425565&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Integrating Behavioural Economics into Climate-Economy Models: Some Policy Lessons,"Various macroeconomic models have been proposed to study the effects of climate policies. But from many corners now, it has been argued that these models are inadequate as tools for policy analysis. In particular, extreme impacts of climate change, inherent uncertainty, and discounting have been widely discussed as flaws of current models. Surprisingly, unrealistic assumptions about individual behaviour, which ignore well-documented behavioural 'anomalies' and social interactions, have attracted little attention so far in the economic analysis of climate change impacts and policies. This article begins to address this gap by providing an overview of formal macro-behavioural models, designed to incorporate a variety of realistic behaviours, such as present bias, habit formation, loss-aversion, and social status into economic theory. We show that ignoring behavioural anomalies may undermine the effectiveness of climate policies, which we illustrate with examples of optimal pollution tax and the social cost of carbon. In addition, we study the probability of the rebound effect in each behavioural model. The rebound effect describes a situation where improvements in energy efficiency render a reduction in energy consumption less than proportional. We show that status concerns make the economy more conducive to the rebound effect compared to a model with fully rational agents. Models of habit formation and loss aversion can have the opposite effect.",1,2273190130, 1779991,Scholarly Journals,,"Safarzynska, Karolina",," Safarzynska, Karolina",, Journal Article, 1752-7457,"  0, 2018",,1469-3062,4, English, English, 485-498,"0, 2018",Climate Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,18,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2273190130?accountid=14505," Climate Policy, vol. 18, no. 4, 2018, pp. 485-98", [URL:http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/tcpo20] Publisher's URL, 485," Micro-Based Behavioral Economics: General (D90) , Macro-Based Behavioral Economics: General (E70) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate , Discounting , Macroeconomics",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Integrating+Behavioural+Economics+into+Climate-Economy+Models%3A+Some+Policy+Lessons&amp;title=Climate+Policy&amp;issn=14693062&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=18&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=485&amp;au=Safarzynska%2C+Karolina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1779991&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Aggregation Dilemma in Climate Change Policy Evaluation,"We show that a policy maker who ignores regional data and instead relies on aggregated integrated assessment models is likely underestimating the carbon price and thus the required climate policy. Based on a simple theoretical model, we give conditions under which the Aggregation Dilemma is expected to play a role in climate change cost-benefit analysis. We then study the importance of the Aggregation Dilemma with the integrated assessment model RICE [Nordhaus and Boyer, (2000) Warning the World: Economic Models of Global Warming. MA: MIT Press]. Aggregating all regions of the RICE-99 model into one region yields a 40% lower social cost of carbon than the RICE model itself predicts. Based on extrapolating the results, a country-level integrated assessment model would give a more than eight times higher social cost of carbon compared to a fully aggregated model. We suggest that these tentative results require researchers to rethink the aggregation level used in integrated assessment models and to develop models at much lower levels of aggregation than currently available.",1,2123702387, 1734165,Scholarly Journals,,"Schumacher, Ingmar",," Schumacher, Ingmar",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, August 2018,,2010-0078,3, English, English, 1-20,August 2018,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,9,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2123702387?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 9, no. 3, August 2018, pp. 1-20", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Aggregation+Dilemma+in+Climate+Change+Policy+Evaluation&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2018-08-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Schumacher%2C+Ingmar&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1734165&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Impact of Population Growth and Population Ethics on Climate Change Mitigation Policy,"Future population growth is uncertain and matters for climate policy: higher growth entails more emissions and means more people will be vulnerable to climate-related impacts. We show that how future population is valued importantly determines mitigation decisions. Using the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, we explore two approaches to valuing population: a discounted version of total utilitarianism (TU), which considers total well being and is standard in social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC) models, and of average utilitarianism (AU), which ignores population size and sums only each time period's discounted average well being. Under both approaches, as population increases the SCC increases, but optimal peak temperature decreases. The effect is larger under TU, because it responds to the fact that a larger population means climate change hurts more people: for example, in 2025, assuming the United Nations (UN)-high rather than UN-low population scenario entails an increase in the SCC of 85% under TU vs. 5% under AU. The difference in the SCC between the two population scenarios under TU is comparable to commonly debated decisions regarding time discounting. Additionally, we estimate the avoided mitigation costs implied by plausible reductions in population growth, finding that large near-term savings ($billions annually) occur under TU; savings under AU emerge in the more distant future. These savings are larger than spending shortfalls for human development policies that may lower fertility. Finally, we show that whether lowering population growth entails overall improvements in well being-rather than merely cost savings-again depends on the ethical approach to valuing population.",1,2059022861, 1708706,Scholarly Journals,,"Scovronick, Noah;Budolfson, Mark B;Dennig, Francis;Fleurbaey, Marc;Siebert, Asher;Socolow, Robert H",," Scovronick, Noah",, Journal Article, 1091-6490, November 2017,,0027-8424,46, English, English, 12338-12343,November 2017,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2017,, American Economic Association,114,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2059022861?accountid=14505," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 114, no. 46, November 2017, pp. 12338-43", [URL:http://www.pnas.org/content/by/section/Economic%20Sciences] Publisher's URL, 12338," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Demographic Trends, Macroeconomic Effects, and Forecasts (J11) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , Climate , Population",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Impact+of+Population+Growth+and+Population+Ethics+on+Climate+Change+Mitigation+Policy&amp;title=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&amp;issn=00278424&amp;date=2017-11-01&amp;volume=114&amp;issue=46&amp;spage=12338&amp;au=Scovronick%2C+Noah%3BBudolfson%2C+Mark+B%3BDennig%2C+Francis%3BFleurbaey%2C+Marc%3BSiebert%2C+Asher%3BSocolow%2C+Robert+H&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1708706&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Recalculating the Social Cost of Carbon,"Over the last few decades, integrated assessment models (IAM) have provided insight into the relationship between climate change, economy, and climate policies. The limitations of these models in capturing uncertainty in climate parameters, heterogeneity in damages and policies, have given rise to skepticism about the relevance of these models for policy making. IAM community needs to respond to these critics and to the new challenges posed by developments in the policy arena. New climate targets emerging from the Paris Agreement and the uncertainty about the signatories' commitment to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are prime examples of challenges that need to be addressed in the next generation of IAMs. Given these challenges, calculating the social cost of carbon requires a new framework. This can be done by computing marginal abatement cost in cost-effective settings which provides different results than those calculated using constrained cost-benefit analysis. Here we focus on the areas where IAMs can be deployed to asses uncertainty and risk management, learning, and regional heterogeneity in climate change impacts.",0,2064762768, 1710294,Working Papers,,"Shayegh, Soheil;Bosetti, Valentina;Dietz, Simon;Emmerling, Johannes;Hambel, Christoph;Jensen, Svenn;Kraft, Holger;Tavoni, Massimo;Traeger, Christian;Van der Ploeg, Rick"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Shayegh, Soheil",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2018",,,, English, English,,"0, 2018","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2018.19, 2018", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2018," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2018.19"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2018.19",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2064762768?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2018.19, 2018", [URL:https://www.feem.it/m/publications_pages/ndl2018-019.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Integrated Assessment Models, Climate Policy, Carbon, Uncertainty",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Recalculating+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shayegh%2C+Soheil%3BBosetti%2C+Valentina%3BDietz%2C+Simon%3BEmmerling%2C+Johannes%3BHambel%2C+Christoph%3BJensen%2C+Svenn%3BKraft%2C+Holger%3BTavoni%2C+Massimo%3BTraeger%2C+Christian%3BVan+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1710294&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

A Social Cost of Carbon for (Almost) Every Country,"This paper uses imputed national climate change impact functions to estimate national social costs of carbon, which are largest in poor countries with large populations. The national social costs of carbon of faster growing economies are less sensitive to the pure rate of time preference and more sensitive to the rate of risk aversion. The pattern of national social costs of carbon is not sensitive to the assumed impact function, climate sensitivity, and scenario, although the global social cost of carbon is. Income convergence raises the national social costs of carbon of poorer countries, and lowers them for richer countries. Both global and national social costs of carbon are most sensitive to the income elasticity of climate change impacts, a parameter about which we know little.",1,2427271304, 1841434,Scholarly Journals, U of Sussex and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Tol, Richard S J",," Tol, Richard S J",, Journal Article,, September 2019,,0140-9883,, English, English, 555-566,September 2019,Energy Economics, CSAPTjournals,2019,, American Economic Association,83,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2427271304?accountid=14505," Energy Economics, vol. 83, pp. 555-566", [URL:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01409883] Publisher's URL, 555," Externalities (D62) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+for+%28Almost%29+Every+Country&amp;title=Energy+Economics&amp;issn=01409883&amp;date=2019-09-01&amp;volume=83&amp;issue=&amp;spage=555&amp;au=Tol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Energy+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1841434&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

The Economic Impacts of Climate Change,"This article reviews the economic impacts of climate change and the policy implications of the results. Current estimates indicate that climate change will likely have a limited impact on the economy and human welfare in the twenty-first century. In fact, the initial impacts of climate change may well be positive. However, in the long run the negative impacts dominate the positive ones. Negative impacts will be substantially greater in poorer, hotter, and lower-lying countries. Poverty reduction complements greenhouse gas emissions reduction as a means to reduce climate change impacts. Although climate change may affect the growth rate of the global economy and may trap more people in poverty, quantification of these impacts remains difficult. The optimal carbon tax in the near term is somewhere between a few tens and a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon.",1,2051647404, 1706948,Scholarly Journals,,"Tol, Richard S J",," Tol, Richard S J",, Journal Article, 1750-6824, January 2018,,1750-6816,1, English, English, 4-25,January 2018,Review of Environmental Economics and Policy," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,12,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2051647404?accountid=14505," Review of Environmental Economics and Policy, vol. 12, no. 1, Winter 2018, pp. 4-25", [URL:https://academic.oup.com/reep/issue] Publisher's URL, 4," Health Behavior (I12) , Land Ownership and Tenure, Land Reform, Land Use, Irrigation, Agriculture and Environment (Q15) , Renewable Resources and Conservation: Water (Q25) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Global , Selected Countries , Climate , Emissions",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Economic+Impacts+of+Climate+Change&amp;title=Review+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Policy&amp;issn=17506816&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=12&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=4&amp;au=Tol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Review+of+Environmental+Economics+and+Policy&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1706948&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Modified Ramsey Discounting for Climate Change,"The Ramsey rule for the consumption rate of discount assumes a transfer of money of a (representative) agent at one point in time to the same agent at another point in time. Climate policy (implicitly) transfers money not just over time but also between agents. I propose three alternative modifications of the Ramsey rule to account for this. Taking the Ramsey rule as given, I derive an intuitively clear but ad hoc modification. Using the assumptions underlying the Ramsey rule, I derive a consistent but more elaborate modification.

The Social Cost of Carbon,"This article surveys the literature on the economic impact of climate change. Different methods have been used to estimate the impact of climate change on human welfare. Studies agree that there are positive and negative impacts. In the short term, positive impacts may dominate, but these are sunk benefits that will obtain regardless of abatement policy. In the longer term, there are net negative impacts. Poorer people tend to be more vulnerable to climate change. Estimated aggregate impacts are not very large, but they are uncertain and incomplete. Estimates of the marginal impacts suggest that greenhouse gas emissions should be taxed and that the emission reduction targets announced by politicians are probably too ambitious. Estimates of the willingness to pay for climate policy suggest that lay people are probably more concerned than experts about the total impact of climate change, whereas lay people and experts agree on estimates of the incremental impact of carbon dioxide emissions.",1,913434404, 1271424,Scholarly Journals,,"Tol, Richard S J",," Tol, Richard S J",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2011",,1941-1340,1, English, English, 419-443,"0, 2011",Annual Review of Resource Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2011,, American Economic Association,3,https://search.proquest.com/docview/913434404?accountid=14505," Annual Review of Resource Economics, vol. 3, no. 1, 2011, pp. 419-43", [URL:http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/loi/resource] Publisher's URL, 419," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Annual+Review+of+Resource+Economics&amp;issn=19411340&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=419&amp;au=Tol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Annual+Review+of+Resource+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1271424&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
International Inequity Aversion and the Social Cost of Carbon,"I define the rate of inequity aversion, distinguishing between the pure rate and the consumption rate. I measure the rate of aversion to inequality in consumption as expressed in the development aid given by rich countries to poor ones between 1965 and 2005. There is an ambiguous relationship between the pure rate of inequity aversion and the consumption rate, driven by the rate of risk aversion. However, for a reasonable choice of the rate of risk aversion, rich countries are shown to be inequity averse, and increasingly so over time. The social cost of carbon is very sensitive to equity weighting and assumptions about the rate of risk and inequity aversion. Estimates of the consumption rate of inequity aversion for recent data suggest that the equity-weighted social cost of carbon is less than 50% larger than the unweighted estimate.",1,1038041939, 1313559,Scholarly Journals,,"Tol, Richard S J",," Tol, Richard S J",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, May 2010,,2010-0078,1, English, English, 21-32,May 2010,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2010,, American Economic Association,1,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1038041939?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 1, no. 1, May 2010, pp. 21-32", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 21," Personal Income, Wealth, and Their Distributions (D31) , Macroeconomics: Consumption, Saving, Wealth (E21) , Macroeconomic Analyses of Economic Development (O11) , Economic Development: Agriculture, Natural Resources, Energy, Environment, Other Primary Products (O13) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Global , Consumption , Development , Inequality",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=International+Inequity+Aversion+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2010-05-01&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=21&amp;au=Tol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1313559&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

The results confirm that a lower discount rate implies a higher estimate; and that higher estimates are found in the gray literature. It is also found that there is a downward trend in the economic impact estimates of the climate; that the Stern Review's estimates of the social cost of carbon is an outlier; and that the right tail of the distribution is fat.

"Essays on Electricity Modeling, Transmission Congestion, and Carbon Policy","The electricity sector represents a major share of the total US energy consumption, and a major emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The electric power sector accounted for 39% of total US energy consumption in 2014, of which 65% was supplied by fossil fuels (Energy Information Administration, 2015). Further, the electricity sector accounted for 2.1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions, or 31% of total GHG emissions in 2013 (US Department of State, 2014). The effects of the regulation of GHG emissions on the electricity sector will inevitably impact the market for electricity. This dissertation characterizes an electricity dispatch model calibrated to the conditions found in the Rocky Mountain Power Area (RMPA), and performs simulations of outcomes in the region under varying GHG policies and transmission conditions. Within the dissertation, three major works are undertaken. The first chapter performs estimates of electricity demand and the nation-wide level in the United States, as well as the interconnect level and by census division. Issues of dynamic adjustment of capital stocks and behavioral rigidity in electricity consumption are modeled using a partial-adjustment framework, which assumes that consumers are able to make less-than-complete adjustment towards the long-run desired level of rational consumption in the face of shocks to the factors of electricity demand. The second chapter determines the effects of carbon taxes on a capital-constrained electricity grid. The five-year time period considered in the chapter allows for investigation into the effects of carbon taxes before capital configurations can be fully adjusted. These effects include whether there are net reductions in carbon emissions, as well as changes in prices across nodes in a regional electricity grid. It further determines the role that congestible transmission plays in the efficacy of GHG policy, and whether carbon charges can exacerbate or alleviate congestion on transmission corridors designed to export coal power. The final chapter reports a simulation designed to investigate whether there is a tradeoff between efficiency in transmission (which reduces total system costs) and the effect that transmission congestion has in limiting the production of CO2 emissions. If the trade-off exists, the increase in total system costs that occurs from transmission congestion would be less than the total cost of paying the carbon tax or the social cost of carbon for the emissions that would have been produced had the congestion not existed. Transmission expansions to reduce congestion could increase emissions, meaning that transmission congestion avoids carbon externalities, and may act as an implicit second-best tax on emissions.",0,1983834534, 1678432,Dissertations & Theses,,"Torell, Gregory",," Torell, Gregory",, Dissertation,,"  0, 2016",,,, English, English,,"0, 2016","University of Wyoming, 2016", CSAPTdissertations,2016, University of Wyoming, American Economic Association  University of Wyoming,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1983834534?accountid=14505," University of Wyoming, 2016",,," Electric Utilities (L94) , Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy (L98) , Hydrocarbon Resources (Q35) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , U.S. , Northern America , Electricity , Electricity Sector , Energy , Gas , Regulation",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:EconLit&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+Electricity+Modeling%2C+Transmission+Congestion%2C+and+Carbon+Policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Torell%2C+Gregory&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1678432&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Closed-Form Integrated Assessment and Uncertainty,"The paper derives the optimal carbon tax in closed-form from an integrated assessment of climate change. The formula shows how carbon, temperature, and economic dynamics quantify the optimal mitigation effort. The model's descriptive power is comparable to numeric models used in policy advising. Uncertainty surrounding climate change remains large, and the paper derives closed-form expressions of welfare loss from shocks and epistemological uncertainty. These expressions interact (intrinsic) risk attitude, distributional moments, and the climatic shadow values, and exhibit different sensitivities to time preference. Welfare gains from reducing uncertainty about temperature feedbacks are much higher than the gains from better measurements of carbon flows.",0,1718046229, 1516809,Working Papers,,"Traeger, Christian"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Traeger, Christian",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2015",,,, English, English,,"0, 2015","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5464, 2015", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2015," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5464"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5464",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1718046229?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 5464, 2015", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/DocBase_Content/WP/WP-CESifo_Working_Papers/wp-cesifo-2015/wp-cesifo-2015-08/cesifo1_wp5464. pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Project Evaluation, Social Discount Rate (H43) , General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical (E13) , Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , climate change, integrated assessment, uncertainty, learning, risk aversion, recursive utility, social cost of carbon, carbon tax, carbon cycle, climate sensitivity",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Closed-Form+Integrated+Assessment+and+Uncertainty&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Traeger%2C+Christian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1516809&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Optimal Climate Policy for a Pessimistic Social Planner,"In this paper we characterize the preferences of a pessimistic social planner concerned with the potential costs of extreme, low-probability climate events. This pessimistic attitude is represented by a recursive optimization criterion a la Hansen and Sargent (1995) that introduces supplementary curvature in the social preferences of standard linear-quadratic optimization analysis and, under certain conditions, it can be shown to correspond to the Epstein-Zin recursive utility. The introduction of extra convexity and the separation between risk-aversion and time-preference implies that, independently of the choice of the discount rate, a sharp, early and steady mitigation effort arises as the optimal climate policy, supporting the main recommendation of the Stern Review (Stern, 2007). Nonetheless, we accommodate for its main criticism of using a too low and questionable discount rate (Nordhaus, 2007), while preserving the assumption of a normal (thin-tailed) probability distribution (Weitzman, 2009). Finally, we argue that our theoretical framework is sufficiently general and robust to possible mis-specifications of the model.",0,1531425678, 1439563,Working Papers,,"Valentini, Edilio;Vitale, Paolo"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Valentini, Edilio",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2014",,,, English, English,,"0, 2014","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.33, 2014", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2014," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.33"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.33",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1531425678?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2014.33, 2014", [URL:http://www.feem.it/userfiles/attach/2014331158404NDL2014-033.pdf] URL,," Optimization Techniques, Programming Models, Dynamic Analysis (C61) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate Change, Climate Policy Targets, Risk Aversion, Pessimism",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Climate+Policy+for+a+Pessimistic+Social+Planner&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Valentini%2C+Edilio%3BVitale%2C+Paolo&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1439563&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
A Simple Formula for the Social Cost of Carbon,"The social cost of carbon (SCC), commonly referred to as the carbon price, is the monetized damage from emitting one unit of CO2 to the atmosphere. The SCC is typically obtained from large-scale computational Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that consolidate interdisciplinary climate research inputs to obtain a carbon price estimate relevant for policy-making. However, the climate economy interactions of IAMs remain inaccessible to scientists in general. Here we develop a simple closed-form formula that captures the key physical and economic determinants of the SCC in the IAMs. For a mainstream IAM, it explains over 99 percent of the within-model variation originating from structural uncertainties; in an inter-model comparison, the structural variation captured by the formula matches closely a SCC distribution of previous SCC estimates. The precise replication of the SCC estimates is strikingly free of details such as those on future policy and technology options, or even carbon concentration levels; the size of the current economy and the emissions-temperature-damage response are the dominant SCC determinants in the IAMs. The structural interpretation given allows decision-makers to disentangle the subjective and structural determinants of the carbon price. Structural uncertainties alone lead to a strongly right-skewed density with median 15 euro/tCO2, mean 31 euro/tCO2, and more than 5 percent probability for higher than 100 euro/tCO2 for year 2015.",0,1492592423, 1409600,Working Papers,,"van den Bijgaart, Inge;Gerlagh, Reyer;Korsten, Luuk;Liski, Matti"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," van den Bijgaart, Inge",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2013.83, 2013", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2013," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2013.83"," American Economic Association  Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2013.83",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1492592423?accountid=14505," Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Working Papers: 2013.83, 2013", [URL:http://www.feem.it/userfiles/attach/20131091012444NDL2013-083.pdf] URL,," Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Pollution Control Adoption and Costs, Distributional Effects, Employment Effects (Q52) , Climate Change, Carbon Price, Integrated Assessment Models, Uncertainty",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=A+Simple+Formula+for+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=van+den+Bijgaart%2C+Inge%3BGerlagh%2C+Reyer%3BKorsten%2C+Luuk%3BLiski%2C+Matti&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1409600&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Pricing Carbon Under Economic and Climactic Risks: Leading-Order Results from Asymptotic Analysis,"Leading-order results from asymptotic analysis for the optimal price of carbon under uncertainty are derived from a macroeconomic continuous-time DSGE model with AK growth, energy use, adjustment costs, recursive utility and costs of global warming. We consider non-climatic productivity growth uncertainty, atmospheric carbon uncertainty, climate sensitivity uncertainty and climate damage uncertainty. Explicit expressions are derived that show the leading-order dependence of the optimal carbon price on these uncertainties, the various climate betas, risk aversion, intergenerational inequality aversion and convexity of the climate damage specification. Our solution allows for skewness and mean reversion in stochastic shocks to the climate sensitivity and damage coefficients. The resulting rule for the optimal risk-adjusted carbon price incorporates precautionary, risk-insurance and risk-exposure effects to deal with future economic and climatic risks. The stochastic processes are calibrated and used to estimate and interpret the impact of each source of uncertainty on the optimal risk-adjusted carbon price.",0,2064752810, 1709633,Working Papers,,"van den Bremer, Ton;van der Ploeg, Frederick"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," van den Bremer, Ton",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2018",,0265-8003,, English, English,,"0, 2018",CEPR Discussion Papers, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2018," C.E.P.R.

"Growth, Renewables, and the Optimal Carbon Tax","Optimal climate policy is investigated in a Ramsey growth model of the global economy with exhaustible oil reserves, an infinitely elastic supply of renewables, stock-dependent oil extraction costs, and convex climate damages. Four regimes can occur, depending on the initial social cost of oil being larger or smaller than that of renewables and depending on the initial oil stock being large or small. We also offer some policy simulations for the first and second regime, which illustrate that with a lower discount rate more oil is left in situ and renewables are phased in more quickly. We identify the conditions under which the optimal carbon tax rises or decreases. Subsidizing renewables (without a carbon tax) induces more oil to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but oil is depleted more rapidly initially.

Growth and the Optimal Carbon Tax: When to Switch from Exhaustible Resources to Renewables?,"Optimal climate policy is studied in a Ramsey growth model. A developing economy weighs global warming less, hence is more likely to exhaust fossil fuel and exacerbate global warming. The optimal carbon tax is higher for a developed economy. We analyze the optimal time of transition from fossil fuel to renewables, amount of fossil fuel to leave in situ, and carbon tax. Subsidizing a backstop without an optimal carbon tax induces more fossil fuel to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but fossil fuel is depleted more quickly.

Is there really a Green Paradox?,"Optimal climate policy is studied in a Ramsey growth model with exhaustible oil reserves, an infinitely elastic supply of renewables, stock-dependent oil extraction costs and convex climate damages. We concentrate on economies with an initial capital stock below that of the steady state of the carbon-free economy and the initial cost of oil (extraction cost plus scarcity rent and social cost of carbon) below that of renewables. There are then two regimes. If the oil stock is small, the social optimum path consists of an initial oil-only phase followed by a renewables-only phase. With a lower cost of renewables or a lower discount rate, more oil is left in situ and renewables are phased in more quickly. The optimal carbon tax rises along its development path during the oil-only phase, but the rise flattens off as less accessible reserves are explored and the social cost of carbon increases. Subsidizing renewables without an optimal carbon tax induces more oil to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but oil is depleted more rapidly initially. The net effect on global warming is ambiguous. The second regime occurs if the initial oil stock is large. The social optimum then consists of an initial oil-only phase followed with a final oil-renewables phase. This regime converges to the steady state of the carbon-free economy as well. The paper also gives a full characterization of two other regimes that occur if the initial capital stock is above its steady state or renewables have an initial cost advantage.",1,1361798785, 1364977,Working Papers,,"van der Ploeg, Frederick;Withagen, Cees"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," van der Ploeg, Frederick",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2010",,,, English, English,,"0, 2010","Tinbergen Institute, Tinbergen Institute Discussion Papers: 10-020/3, 2010", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2010," Tinbergen Institute, Tinbergen Institute Discussion Papers: 10-020/3"," American Economic Association  Tinbergen Institute, Tinbergen Institute Discussion Papers: 10-020/3",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1361798785?accountid=14505," Tinbergen Institute, Tinbergen Institute Discussion Papers: 10-020/3, 2010", [URL:http://papers.tinbergen.nl/10020.pdf] URL,," General Aggregative Models: Neoclassical (E13) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: General (Q30) , Alternative Energy Sources (Q42) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Green Ramsey model, carbon tax, renewables, exhaustible resources, global warming",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Is+there+really+a+Green+Paradox%3F&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=van+der+Ploeg%2C+Frederick%3BWithagen%2C+Cees&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1364977&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Untapped Fossil Fuel and the Green Paradox: A classroom calibration of the optimal carbon tax,"A classroom model of global warming, fossil fuel depletion and the optimal carbon tax is formulated and calibrated. It features iso-elastic fossil fuel demand, stock-dependent fossil fuel extraction costs, an exogenous interest rate and no decay of the atmospheric stock of carbon. The optimal carbon tax reduces emissions from burning fossil fuel, both in the short and medium run. Furthermore, it brings forward the date that renewables take over from fossil fuel and encourages the market to keep more fossil fuel locked up. A renewables subsidy induces faster fossil fuel extraction and thus accelerates global warming during the fossil fuel phase, but brings forward the carbon-free era, locks up more fossil fuel reserves and thus ultimately curbs cumulative carbon emissions and global warming. For relatively large subsidies social welfare is more likely to fall as the economic costs rises more than proportionally with the size of the subsidy. Our calibration suggests that such subsidies are not a good second-best climate policy.",1,1511797084, 1426447,Working Papers,,"Van der Ploeg, Rick"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Van der Ploeg, Rick",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 119, 2013", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2013," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 119"," American Economic Association  University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 119",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1511797084?accountid=14505," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 119, 2013", [URL:http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/13129/Paper119.pdf] URL,," Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue: General (H20) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q31) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , global warming, social cost of carbon, optimal cabon tax, renewables",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Untapped+Fossil+Fuel+and+the+Green+Paradox%3A+A+classroom+calibration+of+the+optimal+carbon+tax&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Van+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1426447&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Abrupt Positive Feedback and the Social Cost of Carbon,"Optimal climate policy should act in a precautionary fashion to deal with tipping points that occur at some future random moment. The optimal carbon tax should include an additional component on top of the conventional present discounted value of marginal global warming damages. This component increases with the sensitivity of the hazard to temperature or the stock of atmospheric carbon. If the hazard of a catastrophe is constant, no correction is needed of the usual Pigouvian tax. The results are applied to a tipping point resulting from an abrupt and irreversible release of greenhouse gases from the ocean floors and surface of the earth, which set in motion a positive feedback loop. Convex enough hazard functions cause overshooting of the carbon tax, but a linear hazard function gives rise to undershooting. A more convex hazard function and a high discount rate speed up adjustment.",1,1496904430, 1410412,Working Papers,,"Van der Ploeg, Rick"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Van der Ploeg, Rick",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 122, 2013", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2013," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 122"," American Economic Association  University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 122",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1496904430?accountid=14505," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 122, 2013", [URL:http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/13080/Paper122.pdf] URL,," Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue: General (H20) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q31) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , social cost of carbon, tipping point, positive feedback, climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Abrupt+Positive+Feedback+and+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Van+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1410412&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Climate Policy and Catastrophic Change: Be Prepared and Avert Risk,"The optimal reaction to a pending climate catastrophe is to accumulate capital to be better prepared for the disaster and levy a carbon tax to reduce the risk of the hazard by curbing global warming. The optimal carbon tax consists of the present value of marginal damages, the non-marginal expected change in welfare caused by a marginal higher risk of catastrophe, and the expected loss in after-catastrophe welfare. The last two terms offset precautionary capital accumulation. A linear hazard function calibrated to an expected time of 15 years for a 32% drop in global GDP if temperature stays at 6 degrees Celsius implies with a discount rate of 1.4% a precautionary return of 1.6% and a carbon tax of 136 US $/tC. More intertemporal substitution lowers precautionary capital accumulation and lessens the need for a high carbon tax, but implies less intergenerational inequality aversion which pushes up the carbon tax.",0,1511797388, 1426446,Working Papers,,"Van der Ploeg, Rick;de Zeeuw, Aart"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Van der Ploeg, Rick",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 118, 2013", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2013," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 118"," American Economic Association  University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 118",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1511797388?accountid=14505," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: OxCarre Research Paper 118, 2013", [URL:http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/13128/Paper118.pdf] URL,," Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue: General (H20) , Economic Growth and Aggregate Productivity: General (O40) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply, Prices (Q31) , Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy (Q38) , non-marginal climate policy, tipping points, risk avoidance, economic growth, social cost of carbon, precaution, adaptation capital",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Climate+Policy+and+Catastrophic+Change%3A+Be+Prepared+and+Avert+Risk&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Van+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick%3Bde+Zeeuw%2C+Aart&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1426446&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Are economists getting climate dynamics right and does it matter?,"We show that several of the most important economic models of climate change produce climate dynamics inconsistent with the current crop of models in climate science. First, most economic models exhibit far too long a delay between an impulse of CO2 emissions and warming. Second, few economic models incorporate positive feedbacks in the carbon cycle, whereby carbon sinks remove less CO2 from the atmosphere, the more CO2 they have already removed cumulatively, and the higher is temperature. These inconsistencies affect economic prescriptions to abate CO2 emissions. Controlling for how the economy is represented, different climate models result in significantly different optimal CO2 emissions. A long delay between emissions and warming leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low and too much sensitivity of optimal carbon prices to the discount rate. Omitting positive carbon cycle feedbacks also leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low. We conclude it is important for policy purposes to bring economic models in line with the state of the art in climate science.",1,2386187646, 1826224,Working Papers,,"Van der Ploeg, Rick;Dietz, Simon;Rezai, Armon;Venmans, Frank",," Van der Ploeg, Rick",, Working Paper,, 2020,,,, English, English,,2020,, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2020," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: 900"," American Economic Association  University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: 900",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2386187646?accountid=14505,, [URL:https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/working_papers/5265/climatedynamics-070220.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , carbon cycle, carbon price, climate change, integrated assessment modelling, positive feedbacks, social cost of carbon",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Are+economists+getting+climate+dynamics+right+and+does+it+matter%3F&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Van+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick%3BDietz%2C+Simon%3BRezai%2C+Armon%3BVenmans%2C+Frank&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1826224&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Asset Pricing and Decarbonization: Diversification versus Climate Action,"Asset pricing and climate policy are analyzed in a global economy where consumption goods are produced by both a green and a carbon-intensive (dirty) sector. We allow for endogenous growth and three types of damages from global warming. It is shown that, initially, the desire to diversify assets in the portfolio complements the attempt to mitigate economic damages from climate change. In the long run, however, there is a trade-off between diversification and climate action. Therefore, in general, the carbon-intensive sector is not shut down completely. We derive the optimal carbon price, the equilibrium risk-free rate, and the risk premium of both assets. The risk-free rate is negatively affected by temperature, while the effect of temperature on the risk premiums depends on the type of damage specification. Climate disasters with an uncertain timing that rises with on temperature leads to a significant effect of climate change on asset prices.",0,2386193722, 1826223,Working Papers,,"Van der Ploeg, Rick;Hambel, Christoph;Kraft, Holger",," Van der Ploeg, Rick",, Working Paper,, 2020,,,, English, English,,2020,, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2020," University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: 901"," American Economic Association  University of Oxford, Department of Economics, Economics Series Working Papers: 901",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2386193722?accountid=14505,, [URL:https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/working_papers/5266/asset-pricing-and-decarbonization-hkp.pdf] URL,," Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty (D81) , Financial Crises (G01) , Equities, Fixed Income Securities (G12) , Environmental Economics: General (Q50) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , climate finance, decarbonization, diversification, carbon price, asset prices, green assets, disaster risk",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Asset+Pricing+and+Decarbonization%3A+Diversification+versus+Climate+Action&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2020-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Van+der+Ploeg%2C+Rick%3BHambel%2C+Christoph%3BKraft%2C+Holger&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1826223&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Simple Rules for Climate Policy and Integrated Assessment,"A simple integrated assessment framework that gives rules for the optimal carbon price, transition to the carbon-free era and stranded carbon assets is presented, which highlights the ethical, economic, geophysical and political drivers of optimal climate policy. For the ethics we discuss the role of intergenerational inequality aversion and the discount rate, where we show the importance of lower discount rates for appraisal of longer run benefit and of policy makers using lower discount rates than private agents. The economics depends on the costs and rates of technical progress in production of fossil fuel, its substitute renewable energies and sequestration. The geophysics depends on the permanent and transient components of atmospheric carbon and the relatively fast temperature response, and we allow for positive feedbacks.

Abandoning Fossil Fuel: How fast and how much?,"Climate change must deal with two market failures, global warming and learning by doing in renewable use. The social optimum requires an aggressive renewables subsidy in the near term and a gradually rising carbon tax which falls in long run.

Endogenous Technological Change in Climate Change Modelling,"This article investigates the impact on optimal CO2 abatement and carbon tax levels of introducing endogenous technological change in a macroeconomic model of climate change. We analyse technological change as a function of cumulative capacity, as incorporated recently in energy-systems models. Our calculations confirm that including endogenous innovation implies earlier emission reduction to meet atmospheric carbon concentration constraints. However, the effect is stronger than suggested in the literature. Moreover, the development of non-fossil energy technologies constitutes the most important opportunity for emission reductions.

Should marginal abatement costs differ across sectors? The effect of low-carbon capital accumulation,"The optimal timing, sectoral distribution, and cost of greenhouse gas emission reductions is different when abatement is obtained though abatement expenditures chosen along an abatement cost curve, or through investment in low-carbon capital. In the latter framework, optimal investment costs differ in each sector: they are equal to the value of avoided carbon emissions, minus the value of the forgone option to invest later. It is therefore misleading to assess the cost-efficiency of investments in low-carbon capital by comparing levelized abatement costs, that is, efforts measured as the ratio of investment costs to discounted abatement. The equimarginal principle applies to an accounting value: the Marginal Implicit Rental Cost of the Capital (MIRCC) used to abate. Two apparently opposite views are reconciled. On the one hand, higher efforts are justified in sectors that will take longer to decarbonize, such as urban planning; on the other hand, the MIRCC should be equal to the carbon price at each point in time and in all sectors. Equalizing the MIRCC in each sector to the social cost of carbon is a necessary condition to reach the optimal pathway, but it is not a sufficient condition. Decentralized optimal investment decisions at the sector level require not only the information contained in the carbon price signal, but also knowledge of the date when the sector reaches its full abatement potential.",0,1361806461, 1367469,Working Papers,,"Vogt-Schilb, Adrien;Meunier, Guy;Hallegatte, Stephane"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Vogt-Schilb, Adrien",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2013",,,, English, English,,"0, 2013","The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6415, 2013", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2013," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6415"," American Economic Association  The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6415",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1361806461?accountid=14505," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6415, 2013", [URL:http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/04/19/000158349_20130419141450/Rendered/PDF/wps6415.pdf] URL,,,https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Should+marginal+abatement+costs+differ+across+sectors%3F+The+effect+of+low-carbon+capital+accumulation&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vogt-Schilb%2C+Adrien%3BMeunier%2C+Guy%3BHallegatte%2C+Stephane&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1367469&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
How inertia and limited potentials affect the timing of sectoral abatements in optimal climate policy,"This paper investigates the optimal timing of greenhouse gas abatement efforts in a multi-sectoral model with economic inertia, each sector having a limited abatement potential. It defines economic inertia as the conjunction of technical inertia--a social planner chooses investment on persistent abating activities, as opposed to choosing abatement at each time period independently--and increasing marginal investment costs in abating activities. It shows that in the presence of economic inertia, optimal abatement efforts (in dollars per ton) are bell-shaped and trigger a transition toward a low-carbon economy. The authors prove that optimal marginal abatement costs should differ across sectors: they depend on the global carbon price, but also on sector-specific shadow costs of the sectoral abatement potential. The paper discusses the impact of the convexity of abatement investment costs: more rigid sectors are represented with more convex cost functions and should invest more in early abatement. The conclusion is that overlapping mitigation policies should not be discarded based on the argument that they set different marginal costs ('""different carbon prices""') in different sectors.",0,1125209625, 1332313,Working Papers,,"Vogt-Schilb, Adrien;Meunier, Guy;Hallegatte, Stephane"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Vogt-Schilb, Adrien",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2012",,,, English, English,,"0, 2012","The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6154, 2012", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2012," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6154"," American Economic Association  The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6154",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1125209625?accountid=14505," The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 6154, 2012", [URL:http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/08/01/000158349_20120801140632/Rendered/PDF/WPS6154.pdf] URL,,,https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=How+inertia+and+limited+potentials+affect+the+timing+of+sectoral+abatements+in+optimal+climate+policy&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vogt-Schilb%2C+Adrien%3BMeunier%2C+Guy%3BHallegatte%2C+Stephane&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1332313&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Marginal Damage Costs of Different Greenhouse Gases: An Application of FUND,"The authors use FUND 3.9 to estimate the social cost of four greenhouse gases--carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur hexafluoride--with sensitivity tests for carbon dioxide fertilization, terrestrial feedbacks, climate sensitivity, discounting, equity weighting, and socioeconomic and emissions assumptions. They also estimate the global damage potential for each gas--the ratio of the social cost of the non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas to the social cost of carbon dioxide. For all gases, they find the social costs and damage potentials sensitive to alternative assumptions. The global damage potentials are compared to global warming potentials (GWPs), a key metric used to compare gases. The authors find that global damage potentials are higher than GWPs in nearly all sensitivities. This finding suggests that previous papers using GWPs may be underestimating the relative importance of reducing non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions from a climate damage perspective. Of particular interest is the sensitivity of results to carbon dioxide fertilization, which notably reduces the social cost of carbon dioxide, but only has a small effect on the other gases. As a result, the global damage potentials for methane and nitrous oxide are much higher with carbon dioxide fertilization included, and higher than many previous estimates.",1,1815666871, 1581590,Scholarly Journals,,"Waldhoff, Stephanie;Anthoff, David;Rose, Steven;Tol, Richard S J",," Waldhoff, Stephanie",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2014",,1864-6042,, English, English, 1-33,"0, 2014","Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal"," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,8,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1815666871?accountid=14505," Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal, vol. 8, 2014, pp. 1-33", [URL:http://www.economics-ejournal.org] Publisher's URL, 1," Land Ownership and Tenure, Land Reform, Land Use, Irrigation, Agriculture and Environment (Q15) , Agricultural R&D, Agricultural Technology, Biofuels, Agricultural Extension Services (Q16) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Climate",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Marginal+Damage+Costs+of+Different+Greenhouse+Gases%3A+An+Application+of+FUND&amp;title=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;issn=18646042&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Waldhoff%2C+Stephanie%3BAnthoff%2C+David%3BRose%2C+Steven%3BTol%2C+Richard+S+J&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Economics%3A+The+Open-Access%2C+Open-Assessment+E-Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1581590&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
On a World Climate Assembly and the Social Cost of Carbon,"This paper postulates the conceptually useful allegory of a futuristic ""World Climate Assembly"" (WCA) that votes for a single worldwide price on carbon emissions via the basic democratic principle of one-person one-vote majority rule. If this WCA framework can be accepted in the first place, then voting on a single internationally-binding minimum carbon price (the proceeds from which are domestically retained) tends to counter self-interest by incentivizing countries or agents to internalize the externality. I attempt to sketch out the sense in which each WCA-agent's extra cost from a higher emissions price is counter-balanced by that agent's extra benefit from inducing all other WCA-agents to simultaneously lower their emissions in response to the higher price. The first proposition of this paper derives a relatively simple formula relating each emitter's single-peaked most-preferred world price of carbon emissions to the world ""Social Cost of Carbon"" (SCC). The second and third propositions relate the WCA-voted world price of carbon to the world SCC. I argue that the WCA-voted price and the SCC are unlikely to differ sharply.

On a World Climate Assembly and the Social Cost of Carbon,"This paper argues that a uniform global tax-like price on carbon emissions, whose revenues each country retains, can provide a focal point for a reciprocal common climate commitment, whereas quantity targets, which do not nearly so readily present such a single focal point, tend to rely ultimately on individual quantity commitments.

A WCA-like uniform price-tax counters self-interest by incentivizing countries or agents to internalize the externality because each WCA agent's higher abatement cost from a higher emissions price is counterbalanced by that agent's extra benefit from inducing all other WCA agents to simultaneously lower their emissions in response to the higher price.

"Rare Disasters, Tail-Hedged Investments, and Risk-Adjusted Discount Rates","What is the best way to incorporate a risk premium into the discount rate schedule for a real investment project with uncertain payoffs? The standard CAPM formula suggests a beta-weighted average of the return on a safe investment and the mean return on an economy-wide representative risky investment. Suppose, though, that the project constitutes a tail-hedged investment, meaning that it is expected to yield positive payoffs in catastrophic states of nature. Then the model of this paper suggests that what should be combined in a weighted average are not the two discount rates, but rather the corresponding two discount factors. This implies an effective discount rate schedule that declines over time from the standard CAPM formula down to the riskfree rate alone. Some simple numerical examples are given. Implications are noted for discounting long-term public investments and calculating the social cost of carbon in climate change.",0,1125216506, 1331851,Working Papers,,"Weitzman, Martin L"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Weitzman, Martin L",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2012",,0898-2937,, English, English,,"0, 2012",NBER Working Paper Series, CSAPTWorkingPapers,2012," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 18496"," American Economic Association  National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 18496",w18496,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1125216506?accountid=14505," National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 18496, 2012", [URL:http://www.nber.org/papers/w18496.pdf] URL,," Interest Rates: Determination, Term Structure, and Effects (E43) , Portfolio Choice, Investment Decisions (G11) , Asset Pricing, Trading Volume, Bond Interest Rates (G12) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Rare+Disasters%2C+Tail-Hedged+Investments%2C+and+Risk-Adjusted+Discount+Rates&amp;title=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;issn=08982937&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=w18496&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weitzman%2C+Martin+L&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=NBER+Working+Paper+Series&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1331851&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Integrated Assessment of Climate Change: State of the Literature,"This paper reviews applications of benefit-cost analysis (BCA) in climate policy assessment at the US national and global scales. Two different but related major application types are addressed. First there are global-scale analyses that focus on calculating optimal global carbon emissions trajectories and carbon prices that maximize global welfare. The second application is the use of the same tools to compute the social cost of carbon (SCC) for use in US regulatory processes. The SCC is defined as the climate damages attributable to an increase of one metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions above a baseline emissions trajectory that assumes no new climate policies. The paper describes the three main quantitative models that have been used in the optimal carbon policy and SCC calculations and then summarizes the range of results that have been produced using them. The results span an extremely broad range (up to an order of magnitude) across modeling platforms as well as across the plausible ranges of input assumptions to a single model. This broad range of results sets the stage for a discussion of the five key challenges that face BCA practitioners participating in the national and global climate change policy analysis arenas: (1) including the possibility of catastrophic outcomes; (2) factoring in equity and income distribution considerations; (3) addressing intertemporal discounting and intergenerational equity; (4) projecting baseline demographics, technological change, and policies inside and outside the energy sector; and (5) characterizing the full set of uncertainties to be dealt with and designing a decision-making process that updates and adapts new scientific and economic information into that process in a timely and productive manner. The paper closes by describing how the BCA models have been useful in climate policy discussions to date despite the uncertainties that pervade the results that have been produced.",0,1692275141, 1501835,Scholarly Journals,,"Weyant, John",," Weyant, John",, Journal Article, 2152-2812,"  0, 2014",,2194-5888,3, English, English, 377-409,"0, 2014",Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2014,, American Economic Association,5,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1692275141?accountid=14505," Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis, vol. 5, no. 3, 2014, pp. 377-409", [URL:https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/all-issues] Publisher's URL, 377," Allocative Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis (D61) , Energy, Environmental, Health, and Safety Law (K32) , Economics of Regulation (L51) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , Benefit Cost , Climate , Welfare",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Integrated+Assessment+of+Climate+Change%3A+State+of+the+Literature&amp;title=Journal+of+Benefit-Cost+Analysis&amp;issn=21945888&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=377&amp;au=Weyant%2C+John&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Benefit-Cost+Analysis&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1501835&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Impact of Climate Change on Marine Recreational Fishing with Implications for the Social Cost of Carbon,"We estimate the effects of temperature and precipitation on marine recreational fishing days over a 20 year time period. The data are from the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation. Our results suggest that temperature and precipitation have positive effects on marine recreational fishing days in the United States. To determine changes in economic value we simulate the effects of climate change on fishing days with changes in U.S. average temperature and precipitation developed from climate models. We use benefit transfer to estimate the value of fishing days. Considering a 4.5F temperature change and a 7% precipitation change, we find that marine recreational fishing days will increase by 27% and the welfare change is $2.5 billion. This suggests that impacts of climate change on marine recreational fishing could have implications for accurate estimation of the social cost of carbon.",0,2013778205, 1688497,Scholarly Journals,,"Whitehead, John;Willard, Daniel",," Whitehead, John",, Journal Article,,"  0, 2016",,2373-8456,2, English, English,,"0, 2016",Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2016,, American Economic Association,3,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2013778205?accountid=14505," Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics, vol. 3, no. 2, 2016", [URL:http://cbe.miis.edu/joce/] Publisher's URL,," Renewable Resources and Conservation: Fishery, Aquaculture (Q22) , Recreational Aspects of Natural Resources (Q26) , Valuation of Environmental Effects (Q51) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , U.S. , Northern America , Climate , Fishing , Recreation , Wildlife",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Impact+of+Climate+Change+on+Marine+Recreational+Fishing+with+Implications+for+the+Social+Cost+of+Carbon&amp;title=Journal+of+Ocean+and+Coastal+Economics&amp;issn=23738456&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=&amp;au=Whitehead%2C+John%3BWillard%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Journal+of+Ocean+and+Coastal+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1688497&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
The Social Cost of Carbon and the Ramsey Rule.,"The objective of this paper is to critically assess the use simple rules for the social cost of carbon (SCC) employing a rudimentary form of the Ramsey rule. Two interrelated caveats apply. First, if climate change poses a serious problem, it is hard to justify an exogenous constant growth rate of consumption. Second, to derive the SCC one needs full knowledge of the entire future. Popular assumptions to get around this, such as assuming current GDP is optimal, are difficult to justify.",0,2160367137, 1745684,Working Papers,,"Withagen, Cees A"," Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: <a href=""http://repec.org"">RePEc</a>"," Withagen, Cees A",, Working Paper,,"  0, 2018",,,, English, English,,"0, 2018","CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7359, 2018", CSAPTWorkingPapers,2018," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7359"," American Economic Association  CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7359",,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2160367137?accountid=14505," CESifo Group Munich, CESifo Working Paper Series: 7359, 2018", [URL:http://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp7359.pdf] URL,," Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54)",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=preprint&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=The+Social+Cost+of+Carbon+and+the+Ramsey+Rule.&amp;title=&amp;issn=&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Withagen%2C+Cees+A&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1745684&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
Optimal Carbon Tax in China with the Perspective of Economic Growth. (In Chinese. With English summary.),"The issue of climate change has become a global concern. Under the background of climate change, exploring a low-carbon economic development model is the common choice of different governments. As the world's top emission country and the largest developing country, China needs to find a way to balance the economic development and carbon emission reductions. As an effective method for achieving emission reduction--carbon tax has always been advocated by governments all over the world. This paper begins with micro perspective and carefully considers the characteristics of China's economic development in the current stage. By applying the dynamic optimal tax model with welfare maximization under the constraint of economic growth, the paper finds the optimal path of carbon tax, and further estimates the macroeconomic impacts of carbon tax using a CGE model. We conclude that carbon taxes are in favor of carbon emission reduction--energy efficiency improvement and industrial structure adjustment. We find that the optimal carbon tax in China is a dynamic and progressive process along with economic growth. We propose that with stronger social affordability in the process of economic growth, the carbon tax can be increased gradually. In practice, we believe a relatively low carbon tax at the beginning would protect the economy and society from large shocks due to carbon tax.",0,859286070, 1158018,Scholarly Journals,,"Yao, Xin;Xiying, Liu",," Yao, Xin",, Journal Article,, November 2010,,0577-9154,11, Chinese, Chinese, 48-58,November 2010,Jingji Yanjiu/Economic Research Journal," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2010,, American Economic Association,45,https://search.proquest.com/docview/859286070?accountid=14505," Jingji Yanjiu/Economic Research Journal, vol. 45, no. 11, November 2010, pp. 48-58", [URL:http://www.erj.cn/en/Issue.aspx?menu_id=20140224101031653012] Publisher's URL, 48," Taxation and Subsidies: Efficiency, Optimal Taxation (H21) , Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities, Redistributive Effects, Environmental Taxes and Subsidies (H23) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environmental Economics: Government Policy (Q58) , China , Asia , Climate , Tax , Taxes",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Optimal+Carbon+Tax+in+China+with+the+Perspective+of+Economic+Growth.+%28In+Chinese.+With+English+summary.%29&amp;title=Jingji+Yanjiu%2FEconomic+Research+Journal&amp;issn=05779154&amp;date=2010-11-01&amp;volume=45&amp;issue=11&amp;spage=48&amp;au=Yao%2C+Xin%3BXiying%2C+Liu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Jingji+Yanjiu%2FEconomic+Research+Journal&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1158018&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit

Sensitivity of Mitigation to the Optimal Global Temperature: An Experiment with DICE,"It is commonly assumed that the temperature which optimizes global production and welfare is the global temperature in 1900. There is an empirical evidence, however, that suggests a slightly warmer, wetter, and CO2 enriched planet which is more productive. This paper explores the sensitivity of mitigation and the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) to different assumptions about the optimal global temperature using DICE 2016R. Each 1 degrees Celsius increase in optimal global temperature lowers the SCC in 2020 by about half and delays the mitigation path by about a decade, but increases the long run temperature only slightly.",1,2083700953, 1719424,Scholarly Journals,,"Yoo, Jonghyun;Mendelsohn, Robert",," Yoo, Jonghyun",, Journal Article, 2010-0086, May 2018,,2010-0078,2, English, English, 1-8,May 2018,Climate Change Economics," CSAPTjournals , CSAPTpeerjournals",2018,, American Economic Association,9,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2083700953?accountid=14505," Climate Change Economics, vol. 9, no. 2, May 2018, pp. 1-8", [URL:http://www.worldscientific.com/loi/cce] Publisher's URL, 1," Environment and Growth (O44) , Climate, Natural Disasters and Their Management, Global Warming (Q54) , Environment and Development, Environment and Trade, Sustainability, Environmental Accounts and Accounting, Environmental Equity, Population Growth (Q56) , Global",https://ucdavis-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/01UCD/01UCD_SP?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Aeconlit&amp;atitle=Sensitivity+of+Mitigation+to+the+Optimal+Global+Temperature%3A+An+Experiment+with+DICE&amp;title=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;issn=20100078&amp;date=2018-05-01&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Yoo%2C+Jonghyun%3BMendelsohn%2C+Robert&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Climate+Change+Economics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1719424&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,EconLit
