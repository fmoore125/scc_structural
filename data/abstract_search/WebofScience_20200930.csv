The main component of natural gas is methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). As the natural gas supply chain grows, there is increased scrutiny over leaks and losses that occur during the multiple stages from development to end users. West Virginia University's (WVU) Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines, and Emissions conducted leak and loss audits at five natural gas compressor and storage facilities in the Barnett Shale region of Texas. We have reported elsewhere on the site-specific total leak and loss rates.([11-13]) This article provides an environmental and economic assessment of the total methane (natural gas) losses at these facilities. Other studies report the methane emissions in terms of tons per year, whereas this paper examines the environmental impact of these emissions through an equivalent CO2 emissions rate using multiple global warming potentials. This paper also examines the lost revenue from these leaks and the overall social cost of carbon (SCC) that could be assessed to these facilities under a proposed carbon tax. The methane leaks and losses from these sites result in CO2 equivalent emissions of over 70000 and 24000 metric tons annually, using a 20-year and 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs), respectively. Using a SCC of $37 per metric ton, this would result in annual costs of $2.6 million and $915000 for these sites based on the respective GWPs.","[Johnson, Derek; Covington, April; Clark, Nigel] W Virginia Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Johnson, D (corresponding author), W Virginia Univ, Mech & Aerosp Engn Dept, 151B ESB,POB 6106, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",derek.johnson@mail.wvu.edu,,,West Virginia University Energy Council; George Berry Chair Endowment; Environmental Defense Fund,"The authors thank the West Virginia University Energy Council, George Berry Chair Endowment, and the Environmental Defense Fund for funding this program.

In this analysis, a stochastic electricity sector simulation model is formulated and used to evaluate alternative strategies prescribing different generation mixes for 2050. The generation mix evolves deterministically, demand is endogenous, and social cost of carbon is randomly sampled. The model treats fossil fuel prices and advanced technology cost dynamics stochastically. Monte Carlo simulation produces a distribution of net present social cost for each strategy, and the alternatives are assessed based on the median (expected cost) and standard deviation (risk). Aggressively expanding renewables is a promising strategy; it has the lowest expected cost and moderate risk. Whether this is preferred to substantial nuclear generation is sensitive to parameter assumptions, but a general finding is robust: severely limiting nuclear generation and substituting liquefied natural gas (LNG) and other fossil fuels is costly and risky. Principal component analysis confirms the vulnerability of such strategies to LNG price and social cost of carbon uncertainty. Japan's dominant short-term response to Fukushima has been a dramatic decrease in nuclear generation coupled with increased use of fossil fuels, particularly LNG. This study suggests that continuing this approach would constitute a poor long-term Japanese electricity strategy.

While a number of studies of the costs of pyrolysis exist, many fail to value the carbon storage benefit associated with biochar. Here, we evaluate the costs of three types of small-scale pyrolysis systems (slow and fast, compared with gasification) in Costa Rica. We find that under many combinations of model parameters, fast and slow pyrolysis models are cost-effective. Net present values are positive for slow pyrolysis at carbon prices above $7 t(-1), indicating that a low carbon price is required to make slow pyrolysis cost-effective. Likewise, fast pyrolysis is cost-effective at any positive carbon price. Gasification is generally more costly than fast or slow pyrolysis, and the net present value of the gasification system is only positive at electricity prices over $0.15 kWh(-1) or carbon prices over $150 t(-1). Thus, both fast and slow pyrolysis models are promising methods for atmospheric CO2 reduction.","[Snyder, Brian F.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Snyder, BF (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Energy Coast & Environm Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",snyderb@lsu.edu,,,,,,68,2,2,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0363-907X,1099-114X,,INT J ENERG RES,Int.

How to design a suitable carbon tax rate is of significance for policy makers. This study aims to address this issue from a microeconomic perspective by exploring the decision behavior of a potential investor. A trinomial tree model based on real options theory is presented to evaluate carbon capture and storage (CCS) investment in coal-fired power plants considering uncertain factors. The model is then applied to a case study and the main findings are as follows: (1) carbon tax policy will have a positive effect on the CCS investment. If the carbon price is not high enough to trigger CCS investment, a hybrid mechanism integrating carbon trading and carbon tax to stimulate CCS investment is required; (2) in applying the trinomial tree real options model, the optimal carbon tax rate should be 145.3 RMB/ton for supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) (or 79.54 RMB/ton for integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)) plants under current market condition and at current technological levels; (3) the optimal carbon tax rate is sensitive to uncertainties. Specifically, the optimal tax rate depends largely on not only the cost of the CCS investment but also the portfolio of carbon price volatility and the initial carbon price level. These conclusions provide the theoretical foundations for decision making regarding CCS investment and related policy making.

Although declining, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV is still above the German wholesale electricity price. However, using LCOE as an evaluation yardstick falls short in at least 2 respects: It neither takes into account integration costs rising with PV penetration (ie, undervaluing its actual cost) nor avoided externalities of replacing conventional for renewable generation (social cost overvaluation). We thus calculate the social profitability of PV in Germany by including not only private costs and benefits but also integration costs to the electricity system and avoided environmental externalities, using the internal rate of return and the profitability index as indicators. Our results show that when these factors are considered, the social profitability of PV in Germany is higher than 10% at the lower bound of the social cost of carbon (150Euro/tCO(2)) up to a penetration level of at least 15% and positive up to a penetration level of at least 25%. Results also show the level of private profitability if all externalities were internalized and assert that subsidies are justified to align private and social profitability. The proposed method could be used as a complementary indicator to private profitability by public institutions, development banks, and companies with social responsibility values.","[Lopez Prol, Javier; Steininger, Karl W.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change, Brandhofgasse 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Lopez Prol, Javier; Steininger, Karl W.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Prol, JL (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",javier.lopez-prol@uni-graz.at,"Steininger, Karl/O-6971-2016","Steininger, Karl/0000-0003-3850-9315; Lopez Prol, Javier/0000-0001-6654-8405",Austrian Science FundAustrian Science Fund (FWF) [W 1256-G15]; European Commission (EU H2020 project TRANSrisk) [642260],"Austrian Science Fund, Grant/Award Number: W 1256-G15: Doctoral Program Climate Change; European Commission (EU H2020 project TRANSrisk), Grant/Award Number: 642260",,60,1,1,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1062-7995,1099-159X,,PROG PHOTOVOLTAICS,Prog.

They are usually reported in a number of different ways: as equivalent costs of global or national economic product in a future period or for a future temperature; as a present value where all future costs are discounted back to a point in time; or as the incremental damage that can be attributed to a marginal increase in emissions, known as the social cost of carbon. This article outlines these aggregate economic measures and assesses the key assumptions and inputs in the estimates, and how these influence the aggregated results. Finally, it discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the estimates and their potential role and applicability for policy. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The paper reports on how the inferred choice of input assumptions, and the method used to pick SCC estimates, affects both the size of SCC values and the uncertainty ranges, and that these implicitly influence policy outcomes. The paper also reviews applications of the SCC in the UK. This reveals the following: (1) There is a potential trade-off between the use of single SCC estimates to ensure consistency, versus use of a range to reflect uncertainty. (2) SCC values are more influential in some sectors than others, which can make it challenging to introduce consistent policies. (3) In some cases the SCC can act as a switching value on major (nonclimate) policy decisions. (4) SCC literature estimates have changed over time, often dramatically. These changes are difficult to implement and policy makers seem to prefer more stable values, even if this means changing input assumptions or methods. (5) For the analysis of climate policy, the decision framework in which SCC values are used makes a large difference to the outcome. (6) There are complex issues and potential inconsistencies involved in applying global SCC values to national decision frameworks comparing costs and benefits. All of these issues caution against a narrow and over-simplistic application of SCC values in regulatory deliberations. Nonetheless, with appropriate caution and caveats, the paper reports that SCC values can have a role in helping to inform policy.

The focus of this analysis is on how these models meet scientific design and transparency criteria recommended by a recent Committee of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, for developing a monetized estimate of the future damages from an incremental increase in carbon dioxide emissions in a given year (i.e., the social cost of carbon dioxide [SC-CO2]). The National Academies report directly addresses methods for estimating the SC-CO2, including a chapter outlining specific recommendations for a carbon/climate module. The carbon/climate piece of the model platform will capture the dispersion of carbon and energy through the earth system, and estimate the resulting change in several globally averaged metrics: temperature change, sea level, and ocean acidity. A number of model characteristics are evaluated and the findings identify models that meet the recommendations associated with each characteristic.

This is because a key model input-namely the valuation of centennial climate damage-is highly unknowable for fundamental reasons discussed here. Problems with damage valuation are highlighted by the implicit implausibility to climate scientists of a leading model's (centennial) damage function, and by strong criticisms of damage functions by many climate economists. The claim that statistical analyses of past weather impacts on local economies, combined with structural modeling of sectoral impacts, can significantly improve centennial damage valuation rests on untestable, far-out-of-sample extrapolation. Testing centennial climate (natural) science projections is generally harder than testing predictions in astronomy, geology and other earth sciences, because of Earth's uniqueness, and the unprecedented degree of likely climate change; but stable underlying laws make climate modeling based on past observations meaningful. By contrast, the added complexity of human behavior means there are no quantitatively stable laws for modeling the value of centennial climate damage. I suggest that any carbon prices used to inform climate policies, be they carbon prices used as policy instruments, or complementary, non-carbon-price policies, should instead be based on marginal abatement costs, found by modeling low-cost pathways to socially agreed, physical climate targets. A pathway approach to estimating carbon prices poses challenges to many economists, and is no panacea, but it avoids any illusion of optimality, and facilitates detailed analysis of sectoral policies.

In this chapter we clarify and expand on a market hypothesis that argues for a second externalized cost of carbon, called the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC), as the appropriate solution to this risk problem. The combination of the SCC and RCC creates a new paradigm of complementary market pricing for the dual objectives of improving market efficiency and managing systemic risk, respectively. Introducing the RCC addresses the problem of how to decouple gross world product (GWP) from carbon emissions and how to solve the paradox of time discounting under systemic risk. Subsequently the RCC could have major implications for climate change economics, public policy, and sustainability theory. The hypothesis is novel by taking into consideration both the entropy and the mass of the carbon budget. The RCC is technically defined as the cost of imposing risk tolerances (%) on climate mitigation objectives, and it has units of USD per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) mitigated. The RCC is internalized with a global carbon reward that manages a trade-off between market efficiency and climate certainty. The carbon reward is issued as a parallel currency and with an exchange rate that is managed by central banks over a rolling 100-year planning horizon. A key recommendation is to test the hypothesis with experiments.","[Chen, Delton B.; Cloud, Jonathan] Ctr Regenerat Community Solut, Basking Ridge, NJ USA; [van der Beek, Joel] EconoVis & EconoLyt, Utrecht, Netherlands","Chen, DB (corresponding author), Ctr Regenerat Community Solut, Basking Ridge, NJ USA.",deltonchen@crcsolutions.org,,,,,,65,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, CH-4052, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-030-03152-7; 978-3-030-03151-0,,,,2019,,,,,,,183,222,,10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7_8,10.1007/978-3-030-03152-7,,40,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BN5CX,WOS:000482972300010,,Other Gold,,,9/30/2020

This paper will argue instead that safe climate policy is not excessively expensive and is indeed cheaper than suggested by most current studies.

It features iso-elastic fossil fuel demand, stock-dependent fossil fuel extraction costs, an exogenous interest rate and no decay of the atmospheric stock of carbon. The optimal carbon tax reduces emissions from burning fossil fuel, both in the short and medium run. Furthermore, it brings forward the date that renewables take over from fossil fuel and encourages the market to keep more fossil fuel locked up. A renewables subsidy induces faster fossil fuel extraction and thus accelerates global warming during the fossil fuel phase, but brings forward the carbon-free era, locks up more fossil fuel reserves and thus ultimately curbs cumulative carbon emissions and global warming. For relatively large subsidies social welfare is more likely to fall as the economic costs rises more than proportionally with the size of the subsidy. Our calibration suggests that such subsidies are not a good second-best alternative for the carbon tax. Of course, such subsidies are required if markets fail to internalize learning-by-doing externalities in renewable production.","[van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","van der Ploeg, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC),"Support from the European Research Council for the Advanced Instigator Grant 'Political Economy of Green Paradoxes' is gratefully acknowledged.

To examine these mechanisms, we observed the shifts in the marginal benefit (MB) and marginal cost (MC) curves of carbon dioxide (CO2) abatement when parameter values are changed. In the observation, we used the DICE model proposed by Nordhaus (A question of balance: weighing the options on global warming policies. Yale University Press, New Haven, 2008) changing 24 parameters for the observation. In consequent, firstly, we have found that discount rate is not only one of the parameters which significantly raise the carbon price, that is, other parameters may have significant impact too. Secondly, we have found that there are two patterns in the rise of the SCC, and three patterns in the rise of the MAC. Thirdly, we have found that the difference between the rise of the SCC and MAC is primarily caused by the horizontal MB curve in CO2 emissions reduction; an upward shift of MC curve raises MAC but never raises the SCC. Thus, the choice of the SCC or MAC may make the change of carbon price different, affecting global warming policy.","[Hatase, Kazushi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama, Japan","Hatase, K (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kazushi.hatase@cantab.net,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427",,,,22,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-847X,1867-383X,,ENVIRON ECON POLICY,Environ.

Updating the distributions of these parameters under varying discount rates is influential on SCC estimates. The lower bound of the social cost of carbon is likely negative and the upper bound is much lower than previously claimed, at least through the mid-twenty-first century.

Our methodology makes explicit the process of conversion of DOC under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as the balance of nutrients. Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated for six alternative scenarios: (i) anaerobic landfilling (current situation); (ii) semi-aerobic landfilling; (iii) landfill gas capture; (iv) composting; (v) pre-composting before landfill; and (vi) biogas production. We calculate that 1 t of waste in anaerobic landfilling emits 1.70 t CO2-eq. with life-cycle perspective. Lowest emission occurs in biogas scenario with 0.26 t CO2-eq./t. Composting occupies an intermediate position with 0.39 t CO2-eq./t. Likewise, we estimate that cost of emission reduction in solid waste sector of Vietnam is 15.13 US$/t CO2-eq., given by alternative of composting and taking anaerobic landfilling as reference. On the other hand, if social cost of carbon (SCC) is incorporated lowest cost to treat 1 t of waste is given by composting and semi-aerobic landfilling at discount rate of 5 %. However, using lower discount rates, and consequently higher values of SCC, composting and biogas production become the alternatives with lowest treatment costs.","[Otoma, Suehiro; Diaz, Ricardo] Univ Kitakyushu, Grad Sch Environm Engn, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Diaz, Ricardo] 1-1 Hibikino,Wakamatsu Ku, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan","Diaz, R (corresponding author), Univ Kitakyushu, Grad Sch Environm Engn, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan.; Diaz, R (corresponding author), 1-1 Hibikino,Wakamatsu Ku, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8080135, Japan.",otoma@kitakyu-u.ac.jp; rdiazb@yahoo.com,,,,,,46,4,4,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1438-4957,1611-8227,,J MATER CYCLES WASTE,J.

These reviews, however, have been limited to measuring 'objective' risks and expected material damage related to climate change. The 'subjective' perceived risk of climate change and society's willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid these risks are expected to provide an important additional motivation for direct action. We investigate whether and why air travel passengers-an increasingly important source of greenhouse gas emissions-are supportive of measures that increase the cost of their travel based on the polluter pays principle and compensate the damage caused by their flight. Compared to the results of the few previous studies that have elicited WTP estimates for climate policy more generally, our results appear to be at the lower end of the scale, while a comparison to estimates of the social cost of carbon shows that the average WTP estimate in this study is close to the estimated marginal damage cost. Although significant differences are found between travellers from Europe, North America, Asia and the rest of the world, we show that there exists a substantial demand for climate change mitigation action. The positive risk premium over and above the expected property damage cost assessments should be accounted for more explicitly in economic reviews as it will add to the burden of proof of direct action. Measurements of passenger WTP will help policy makers to design effective financial instruments aimed at discouraging climate-unfriendly travel activities as well as to generate funds for the measures directed at climate change mitigation and adaptation. Based on stated WTP by travellers to offset their greenhouse gas emissions, funds in the order of magnitude of (sic)23 billion could be generated annually to finance climate change mitigation activities.","[Brouwer, R.; Brander, L.; Van Beukering, P.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Brouwer, R (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",roy.brouwer@ivm.vu.nl,"Brander, Luke/M-8878-2013; Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013; van Beukering, Pieter/L-3509-2013","Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050; Brander, Luke/0000-0002-5862-4030; van Beukering, Pieter/0000-0001-7146-4409",,,,36,144,149,3,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We also compare differences in simulated temperature increase resulting from moving from a high to a low emissions scenario. These IAMs offer a range of climate outcomes, some of which are inconsistent with those of IPCC, due to differing treatments of the carbon cycle and of the temperature response to radiative forcing. In particular, in FUND temperatures up until 2100 are relatively similar for the four emissions scenarios, and temperature reductions upon switching to lower emissions scenarios are small. PAGE incorporates strong carbon cycle feedbacks, leading to higher CO2 concentrations in the twenty-second century than other models. Such IAMs are frequently applied to determine 'optimal' climate policy in a cost-benefit approach. Models such as FUND which show smaller temperature responses to reducing emissions than IPCC simulations on comparable timescales will underestimate the benefits of emission reductions and hence the calculated 'optimal' level of investment in mitigation.","[Warren, R.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Tyndall Ctr, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mastrandrea, M.

Yet economic assessments of its effects are currently almost absent. Unlike most other marine organisms, mollusks, which have significant commercial value worldwide, have relatively solid scientific evidence of biological impact of acidification and allow us to make such an economic evaluation. By performing a partial-equilibrium analysis, we estimate global and regional economic costs of production loss of mollusks due to ocean acidification. Our results show that the costs for the world as a whole could be over 100 billion USD with an assumption of increasing demand of mollusks with expected income growths combined with a business-as-usual emission trend towards the year 2100. The major determinants of cost levels are the impacts on the Chinese production, which is dominant in the world, and the expected demand increase of mollusks in today's developing countries, which include China, in accordance with their future income rise. Our results have direct implications for climate policy. Because the ocean acidifies faster than the atmosphere warms, the acidification effects on mollusks would raise the social cost of carbon more strongly than the estimated damage adds to the damage costs of climate change.","[Narita, Daiju; Rehdanz, Katrin] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Rehdanz, Katrin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Tol, Richard S.

We begin with a warning to beware of analyses that are so narrow that they miss a good deal of the important economic ramifications of the full suite of manifestations of climate change. Our second set of comments focuses attention on one of the most visible products of integrated assessment modeling-estimates of the social cost of carbon which we take as one example of aggregate economic indicators that have been designed to summarize climate risk in policy deliberations. Our point is that these estimates are so sensitive to a wide range of parameters that improved understanding of economic damages across many (if not all) climate sensitive sectors may offer only limited value added. Having cast some doubt on the ability of improved estimates of economic damages to increase the value of economic damage estimates in integrated assessment modeling designed to inform climate policy deliberations, we offer an alternative approach-describing implicitly a research agenda that could (a) effectively inform mitigation decisions while, at the same time, (b) providing economic estimates for aggregate indicators like the social cost of carbon.","[Yohe, Gary] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06480 USA; [Hope, Chris] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England","Yohe, G (corresponding author), Wesleyan Univ, 238 Church St, Middletown, CT 06480 USA.",gyohe@wesleyan.edu,,,,,,12,3,3,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

In particular, there are multiple potential tipping points and they are not all low-probability events; at least one has a significant probability of being passed this century under mid-range (2-4 A degrees C) global warming, and they cannot all be ruled out at low (< 2 A degrees C) warming. In contrast, the dominant framing of climate catastrophes in IAMs, and in critiques of them, is that they are associated with high (> 4 A degrees C) or very high (> 8 A degrees C) global warming. This discrepancy could qualitatively alter the predictions of IAMs, including estimates of the social cost of carbon. To address this discrepancy and assess the economic impact of crossing different climate tipping points, we highlight a list of scientific points that should be considered, at least in a stylised form, in simplified IAMs. For nine different tipping events, the range of expected physical climate impacts is summarised and some suggestions are made for how they may translate into socio-economic impacts on particular sectors or regions. We also consider how passing climate tipping points could affect economic growth.","[Lenton, Timothy M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Labs, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Ciscar, Juan-Carlos] Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Joint Res Ctr, Seville 41092, Spain","Lenton, TM (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Hatherly Labs, Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England.",t.m.lenton@exeter.ac.uk,"Lenton, Tim M/X-1893-2018","Lenton, Tim M/0000-0002-6725-7498",Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F005474/2] Funding Source: Researchfish,,,44,52,53,3,92,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

The default PAGE09 model gives a mean estimate of the social cost of CO2 (SCCO2) of $106 per tonne of CO2, compared to $81 from the PAGE2002 model used in the Stern review (Stern 2007). The increase is the net result of several improvements that have been incorporated into the PAGE09 model in response to the critical debate around the Stern review: the adoption of the A1B socio-economic scenario, rather than A2 whose population assumptions are now thought to be implausible; the use of ranges for the two components of the discount rate, rather than the single values used in the Stern review; a distribution for the climate sensitivity that is consistent with the latest estimates from IPCC 2007a; less adaptation than in PAGE2002, particularly in the economic sector, which was criticised for possibly being over-optimistic; and a more theoretically-justified basis of valuation that gives results appropriate to a representative agent from the focus region, the EU.

However, when applied to temperature targets under climate sensitivity uncertainty, decision-makers might be confronted with normatively unappealing negative expected values of future climate information or even infeasible solutions. To tackle these issues, Cost-Risk Analysis (CRA), that trades-off the costs for mitigating climate change against the risk of exceeding climate targets, has been proposed as an extension of CEA under uncertainty. Here we build on this proposition and develop an axiomatically sound CRA for the context of uncertainty and future learning. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) we show, that a risk-penalty function has to be non-concave to avoid counter-intuitive preferences, (ii) we introduce a universally applicable calibration of the cost-risk trade-off, and (iii) we implement the first application of CRA to a numerical integrated assessment model. We find that for a 2A degrees-target in combination with a 66 % compliance level, the expected value of information in 2015 vs. 2075 is between 0.15 % and 0.66 % of consumption every year, and can reduce expected mitigation costs by about one third.

Despite this, climate damages attributable to current emissions that occur beyond 150 years or so have almost no effect on the current optimal carbon tax in typical integrated assessment models. The source of this strong result is conventional economic discounting. The current paper builds on recent work by Gerlagh and Liski (2013) and Iverson (J Environ Econ Manag 66:598-608, 2013a, b) to demonstrate this fact in a simple way and to show that it is not robust to plausible changes in the calibration approach for discounting parameters. Specifically, when time preference rates decline, a possibility supported by a wide variety of studies from psychology and economics, long run consumption impacts are potentially very important and so are long run features of the carbon cycle. The paper follows (Gerlagh and Liski 2013) in showing that this remains true even when the discounting parameters are calibrated to match historical interests rates, thus avoiding the main economic critique of the Stern Review (Stern 2007; Nordhaus 2008; Weitzman Rev Econ Stat 91:1-19 2009). The effects are quantified using a formula for the optimal carbon tax from Iverson (J Environ Econ Manag 66:598-608, 2013a, b), which we use to decompose the current optimal tax into the cumulative contribution from consumption impacts at different horizons.","[Iverson, Terrence; Zahran, Sammy] Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Denning, Scott] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Iverson, T (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",terry.iverson@colostate.edu,,"Iverson, Terrence/0000-0003-1519-8358",,,,43,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Values consistently incorporate health impacts of air quality along with climate damages. The latter include damages associated with aerosol-induced hydrologic cycle changes that lead to net climate benefits when reducing cooling aerosols. Evaluating a 1 % reduction in current global emissions, benefits with a high discount rate are greatest for reductions of co-emitted products of incomplete combustion (PIC), followed by sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and then CO2, ammonia and methane. With a low discount rate, benefits are greatest for PIC, with CO2 and SO2 next, followed by NOx and methane. These results suggest that efforts to mitigate atmosphere-related environmental damages should target a broad set of emissions including CO2, methane and aerosol/ozone precursors. Illustrative calculations indicate environmental damages are $330-970 billion yr(-1) for current US electricity generation (14-34A cent per kWh for coal, 4-18A cent for gas) and $3.80 (-1.80/+2.10) per gallon of gasoline ($4.80 (-3.10/+3.50) per gallon for diesel). These results suggest that total atmosphere-related environmental damages plus generation costs are much greater for coal-fired power than other types of electricity generation, and that damages associated with gasoline vehicles substantially exceed those for electric vehicles.","Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Shindell, DT (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, POB 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",drew.shindell@duke.edu,"Shindell, Drew/D-4636-2012","Shindell, Drew/0000-0003-1552-4715",,,,50,61,62,1,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

It pays special attention to the 2 A degrees C temperature target and tells us that the window of opportunity to prevent such climate change is rapidly closing. Yet, the report also presents a portfolio of stabilization targets, reflecting a fundamental ambiguity: there is no unique dangerous climate threshold. Here, we describe a framework for the evaluation of optimal climate policy given an uncertain formal climate threshold. We find that uncertainty leads to moving targets: even when the available information does not change, future regulators will tend to relax current climate plans. We develop a reduced form integrated assessment model to assess the quantitative significance of our findings. We calibrate preferences such that in 2000 a stabilization target of 450 ppmv maintains the optimal balance between climate risks and abatement costs. The na < ve equilibrium ultimately reaches a peak of 570 ppmv, missing the 2000 stabilizations targets by a wide margin. Our results offer an explanation for the inertia in mitigation efforts over the past decades: policies often delay the majority of abatement efforts.

This safe carbon budget is low if uncertainty about the transient climate response is high and risk tolerance (willingness to accept risk of overshooting the temperature target) is low. Together with energy costs, this budget determines the optimal carbon price and how quickly fossil fuel is abated and replaced by renewable energy. This price is the sum of the present discounted value of all future losses in aggregate production due to emitting one ton of carbon today plus the cost of peak warming that rises over time to reflect the increasing scarcity of carbon as temperature approaches its upper limit. If policy makers ignore production losses, the carbon price rises more rapidly. If they ignore the peak temperature constraint, the carbon price rises less rapidly. The alternative of adjusting damages upwards to factor in the peak warming constraint leads initially to a higher carbon price which rises less rapidly.","[van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, OXCARRE, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia","van der Ploeg, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, OXCARRE, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.; van der Ploeg, F (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.; van der Ploeg, F (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,43,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are approaches that integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework, and these are particularly important for climate change. One of the earliest IAMs for climate change was the DICE/RICE family of models, first published in Nordhaus (Science 258:1315-1319, 1992a), with the latest version in Nordhaus (2017, 2018). A difficulty in assessing IAMs is the inability to use standard statistical tests because of the lack of a probabilistic structure. In the absence of statistical tests, the present study examines the extent of revisions of the DICE model over its quarter-century history. The study finds that the major revisions have come primarily from the economic aspects of the model, whereas the environmental changes have been much smaller.

Combining disparate information sources is mathematically complex; common heuristics based on simple statistical models easily lead us astray. Here, we use Bayesian Nets (BNs) to illustrate the complexity in reasoning under uncertainty. Data from joint research at Resources for the Future and NASA Langley are used to populate a BN for predicting equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The information sources consist of measuring the rate of decadal temperature rise (DTR) and measuring the rate of percentage change in cloud radiative forcing (CRF), with both the existing configuration of satellites and with a proposed enhanced measuring system. The goal of all measurements is to reduce uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity. Subtle aspects of probabilistic reasoning with concordant and discordant measurements are illustrated. Relative to the current prior distribution on ECS, we show that after 30years of observing with the current systems, the 2 sigma uncertainty band for ECS would be shrunk on average to 73% of its current value. With the enhanced systems over the same time, it would be shrunk to 32% of its current value. The actual shrinkage depends on the values actually observed. These results are based on models recommended by the Social Cost of Carbon methodology and assume a Business as Usual emissions path.","[Cooke, Roger M.] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wielicki, Bruce] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Sci Directorate, 21 Langley Blvd, Hampton, VA 23681 USA","Cooke, RM (corresponding author), Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",cooke@rff.org,"Wielicki, Bruce/AAX-3676-2020","cooke, roger/0000-0003-0643-1971",,,,32,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

We observe that hotter than the average temperature is not only detrimental to production efficiency growth but also makes the growth less stable than otherwise, and these effects are larger in very hot countries with average annual temperature greater than 25 degrees C. More importantly, we observe that the detrimental marginal effects of higher temperature depend on the level of economic development of a country; they are larger for poor countries relative to rich countries.

The climate policies are described in terms of two main outcome variables: future effects on income in 2100 and present-time provision of co-benefits from climate policy. Both outcomes are described for three specific regions of the world, Western Europe, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. For each participant, one policy choice is drawn at random to be realized.

Survey questions on the magnitude of climate impacts and appropriate discount rates revealed that prevailing views differ from prominent IAMs, including DICE. We calibrate the DICE damage functions and discount rates to reflect the mean and median survey responses, respectively, recognizing these two parameters' differing sources of uncertainty (positive versus normative). We find a 16-fold higher SCC than the base DICE-2013R assumptions, with a range of 11- to 24-fold under alternative modeling assumptions (using the DICE-2016R2 model version and calibrating damages to median rather than mean responses).

We use a model of intertemporal expected utility maximisation to analyse this question. Similar to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) the rate of return depends on the correlation of risk between the return on investments in climate change mitigation and the market portfolio, but in contrast to the classical CAPM we admit the fact that economic and environmental systems are jointly determined, implying that environmental risk is endogenous. Therefore, investments in climate change mitigation may reduce risk via self-protection and self-insurance. If risk reduction is accounted for in cost-benefit evaluations, climate investments may be justified despite low expected return. These aspects of climate investments are not, however, communicated via standard cost-benefit analyses of climate policy. Optimal climate policy may therefore be more ambitious than previously considered.","ECON Anal, N-0051 Oslo, Norway; Molde Res Inst, N-6411 Molde, Norway","Vennemo, H (corresponding author), ECON Anal, POB 5, N-0051 Oslo, Norway.",hve@econ.no,,,,,,28,14,15,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Recent literature suggests that this compliance cost dividend is significant (Fell and Morgenstern Environ Resour Econ 47:275-297, 2010). Allowance banking may yield an environmental dividend (a) if the growth rate of marginal damages from emissions is less than the discount rate and (b) if emissions are lower in the short run as firms bank permits for use in later periods. A discrete, stochastic dynamic programming model is considered to simulate the two dividends of allowance banking in the context of the most recent Federal United States greenhouse gas cap-and-trade legislation. Simulation results show that under a range of parameter values, the environmental dividend has the same order of magnitude as the compliance cost dividend. Under the central set of parameters, allowance banking increases expected present value of benefits by about million dollars per year of the program. The environmental dividend, however, is completely eliminated if capped firms can borrow permits from future periods without limit.","Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Leard, B (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 316 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",BPL47@cornell.edu,,,,,,25,2,2,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Climate economics, therefore, is centrally concerned with the treatment of risk and time. Yet conventional assumptions about utility and optimal economic growth create a perverse connection between risk aversion and time preference, such that more aversion to current risks implies less concern for future outcomes, and vice versa. The same conflation of risk aversion and time preference leads to the equity premium puzzle in finance. A promising response to the equity premium puzzle, the recursive utility of Epstein and Zin, allows separation of risk aversion and time preference-at the cost of considerable analytic complexity. We introduce an accessible implementation of Epstein-Zin utility into the DICE model of climate economics, creating a hybrid EZ-DICE model. Using Epstein-Zin parameters from the finance literature and climate uncertainty parameters from the science literature, we find that the optimal climate policy in EZ-DICE calls for rapid abatement of carbon emissions; it is similar to standard DICE results with the discount rate set to equal the risk-free rate of return. EZ-DICE solutions are sensitive to the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, but remarkably insensitive to risk aversion. Insensitivity to risk aversion may reflect the difficulty of modeling catastrophic risks within DICE. Implicit in DICE are strong assumptions about the cost of climate stabilization and the certainty and speed of success; under these assumptions, risk aversion would in fact be unimportant. A more realistic analysis will require a subtler treatment of catastrophic climate risk.","[Ackerman, Frank; Stanton, Elizabeth A.; Bueno, Ramon] Synapse Energy Econ, Cambridge, MA USA; [Bueno, Ramon] Stockholm Environm Inst US Ctr, Somerville, MA USA","Ackerman, F (corresponding author), Synapse Energy Econ, Cambridge, MA USA.",frankackerman12@gmail.com; stantonea88@gmail.com; Ramon.Bueno@sei-us.org,,"Ackerman, Frank/0000-0002-7940-482X",,,,26,21,21,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Policy-bloc firms benefit from free quota allocations, which are updated according to either firms' past emissions, or outputs. We show that the resulting abatement and its allocation between policy bloc and fringe are both inefficient. When all quotas are traded freely at a single price, the policy bloc chooses to either not constrain the offset market, leading to suboptimal policy-bloc mitigation; or ban offsets completely. The former (latter) case occurs when free allocation of quotas is not (very) generous, and the offset market is large (small). It is preferable for policy-bloc countries' governments to instead buy offsets directly from the fringe at a quota price below marginal damage cost of emissions, while the policy-bloc quota price will be above this cost. With maximization of global welfare and a unified quota price, this price is higher, and offsets constrained in fewer cases, but the solution still inefficient.

Reducing methane emissions will both slow anthropogenic climate change and reduce ozone-related mortality. We estimate the benefits of reducing methane emissions anywhere in the world for ozone-related premature mortality globally and for eight geographic regions. Our methods are consistent with those used by the US Government to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC). We find that the global short- and long-term premature mortality benefits due to reduced ozone production from methane mitigation are (2011) $790 and $1775 per tonne methane, respectively. These correspond to approximately 70 and 150 % of the valuation of methane's global climate impacts using the SCC after extrapolating from carbon dioxide to methane using global warming potential estimates. Results for monetized benefits are sensitive to a number of factors, particularly the choice of elasticity to income growth used when calculating the value of a statistical life. The benefits increase for emission years further in the future. Regionally, most of the global mortality benefits accrue in Asia, but 10 % accrue in the United States.

This view is influential both in moral philosophy, and in theoretical work on social choice-where it is captured by a social welfare function (SWF) summing a concave transformation of individual well-being numbers. However, prioritarianism has largely been ignored by scholarship on climate change. This Article compares utilitarianism and prioritarianism as frameworks for evaluating climate policy. It reviews the distinctive normative choices that are required for the prioritarian approach: specifying a ratio scale for well-being (if the prioritarian SWF takes the standard Atkinson form); determining the degree of concavity of the transformation function (i.e., the degree of social inequality aversion); and choosing between ex ante and ex post prioritarianism under conditions of risk. The Article also sketches some of salient implications of a prioritarian SWF for climate policy-with respect to the social cost of carbon, the social discount rate, optimal mitigation, and the dismal theorem. Finally, it discusses the issue of variable population.","[Adler, Matthew D.] Duke Univ, Sch Law, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Treich, Nicolas] INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, F-31931 Toulouse, France","Adler, MD (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Law, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",adler@law.duke.edu,"Treich, Nicolas/AAX-2608-2020","Treich, Nicolas/0000-0001-5840-4735",chair Finance Durable et Investissement Responsable (FDIR),"This article grows out of presentations by the authors at conferences on climate change held at Duke University, Goteborg University, and Princeton University; at the conference of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE); and at the Snowmass modelling workshop.

Now green industrial policy is gaining popularity as governments search for low-carbon solutions that also provide jobs at home. The strategic trade literature has largely ignored the issue of market failures related to green goods. I consider the market for a new environmental good (like low-carbon technology) whose downstream consumption provides external benefits (like reduced emissions). Governments may have some preference for supporting domestic production, such as by interest-group lobbying, introducing a political distortion in their objective function. I examine the national incentives and global rationales for offering production (upstream) and deployment (downstream) subsidies in producer countries, allowing that some of the downstream market may lie in nonregulating third-party countries. Restraints on upstream subsidies erode global welfare when environmental externalities are large enough relative to political distortions. Climate finance is an effective alternative if political distortions are large and governments do not undervalue carbon costs. Numerical simulations of the case of renewable energy indicate that a modest social cost of carbon can imply benefits from allowing upstream subsidies.","[Fischer, Carolyn] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Fischer, Carolyn] FEEM, Venice, Italy; [Fischer, Carolyn] CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany","Fischer, C (corresponding author), Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.; Fischer, C (corresponding author), FEEM, Venice, Italy.; Fischer, C (corresponding author), CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany.",fischer@rff.org,"Fischer, Carolyn/M-4362-2016","Fischer, Carolyn/0000-0001-6179-1377","European Community's Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Incoming Fellowship, STRATECHPOL-Strategic Clean Technology Policies for Climate Change under the EC Grant [PIIF-GA-2013-623783]; US Environmental Protection Agency Grant [83413401]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA) INDIGO program","Fischer would like to acknowledge the European Community's Marie Sklodowska-Curie International Incoming Fellowship, STRATECHPOL-Strategic Clean Technology Policies for Climate Change, financed under the EC Grant Agreement PIIF-GA-2013-623783, and the hospitality of the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM).

The scientific assessment is driven to a large extent by assumptions regarding its effectiveness, costs, and impacts, all of which are profoundly uncertain. We investigate how this uncertainty about climate engineering affects the optimal abatement policy in the near term. Using a two period model of optimal climate policy under uncertainty, we show that although abatement decreases in the probability of success of climate engineering, this relationship is concave implying a rather 'flat' level of abatement as the probability of climate engineering becomes a viable policy option. Using a stochastic version of an integrated assessment model, the results are found to be robust to a wide range of specifications. Moreover, we numerically evaluate different correlation structures between climate engineering and the equilibrium climate sensitivity.","[Emmerling, Johannes; Tavoni, Massimo] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Emmerling, Johannes; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, Dept Management & Econ, Milan, Italy","Emmerling, J (corresponding author), FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.; Emmerling, J (corresponding author), Ctr Euro Mediterraneo & Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",johannes.emmerling@feem.it; massimo.tavoni@feem.it,"EMMERLING, Johannes/K-8283-2019","EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913; tavoni, massimo/0000-0001-5069-4707",European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [308329],"The authors would like to thank Reyer Gerlagh, Martin Weitzman, Scott Barrett, participants of a Workshop on Coupled Climate-Economics Modelling and Data Analysis at ENS, Paris, the FEEM-CMCC convention 2012 in Venice, and the AERE 2013 conference in Banff, and two anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments.

Our main contribution is to introduce and explore the natural time lag of the climate system between emissions and damages to capital accumulation in an endogenous growth setting. This allows us to investigate how optimal climate policy, and its interplay with climate dynamics, affect long-run growth and the transition of the economy towards it. Without pollution decay, a higher speed of emissions diffusion steepens the growth profile of the economy. With pollution decay, this leads to lower short-run but higher long-run economic growth during transition. Poor understanding of the emissions diffusion process leads to suboptimal carbon taxes, resource extraction and growth.","[Bretschger, Lucas; Karydas, Christos] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Karydas, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",lbretschger@ethz.ch; karydasc@ethz.ch,,,,,,30,6,6,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Due to limited data availability, previous meta-analyses of global climate damages potentially suffered from multiple sources of coefficient and standard error bias: duplicate estimates, omitted variables, measurement error, overreliance on published estimates, dependent errors, and heteroskedasticity. To address and test for these biases, we expand on previous datasets to obtain sufficient degrees of freedom to make the necessary model adjustments, including dropping duplicate estimates and including methodological variables. Estimating the relationship between temperature and climate damages using weighted least squares with cluster-robust standard errors, we find strong evidence that duplicate and omitted variable biases flatten the relationship. However, the magnitude of the bias greatly depends on the treatment of speculative high-temperature (> 4 C) damage estimates. Replacing the DICE-2013R damage function with our preferred estimate of the temperature-damage relationship, we find a three- to four-fold increase in the 2015 SCC relative to DICE, depending on the treatment of productivity. When catastrophic impacts are also factored in, the SCC increases by four- to five-fold.","[Howard, Peter H.] NYU, Inst Policy Integr, Sch Law, Wilf Hall,139 MacDougal St,Third Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Sterner, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden","Howard, PH (corresponding author), NYU, Inst Policy Integr, Sch Law, Wilf Hall,139 MacDougal St,Third Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",HowardP@mercury.law.nyu.edu; thomas.sterner@economics.gu.se,,,,,,81,25,25,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The unit production cost of the green goods involves convexity and learning-by-doing. The total cost for the social planner includes the private cost of production and the social cost of carbon, assumed to be exogenous and growing at the social discount rate. Under these assumptions the optimization problem can be decomposed in two questions: (i) when to launch a given schedule; (ii) at which rate the transition should be completed that is, the design of a transition schedule as such. The first question can be solved using a simple indicator interpreted as the MAC of the whole schedule, possibly non optimal.

This pessimistic attitude is represented by a recursive optimization criterion A la Hansen and Sargent (IEEE Trans Autom Control 40:968-971, 1995) implying that a very sharp and early mitigation effort arises as the optimal climate policy. We find that for sufficiently high levels of risk-aversion an aggressive mitigation policy is chosen even when the discount factor is low. The dynamics of the optimal mitigation policy displays an inverted policy ramp with a sharp and immediate mitigation effort, followed by a gradual reduction until the pollution stock converges towards its long-run equilibrium. We also observe that the initial sharpness of the mitigation effort requires substantial capture and sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere. We extend our analysis showing that when the social planner observes the concentration and emission levels with a time lag, she undertakes a more aggressive policy to reduce the greater degree of uncertainty she faces. Finally, we show under which conditions the optimal mitigation policy dictated by our analysis coincides with that derived using the robustness approach of Hansen and Sargent (Robustness, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008).","[Valentini, Edilio; Vitale, Paolo] Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy","Valentini, E (corresponding author), Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Italy.",valentin@unich.it; p.vitale@unich.it,,"Valentini, Edilio/0000-0001-7170-2868",,,,33,0,0,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The framework includes nonrenewable natural resources which cause greenhouse gas emissions; pollution stock harms capital and reduces economic growth. We find a big effect of the selected damage function on the social cost of carbon and a significant impact on the growth rate. In our calibration a quartic damage function raises the social cost of carbon by more than a factor of ten compared to the linear function. In the social optimum the growth rate remains positive even when the damage function is highly convex. We test the robustness of the results by adding pollution decay, lowering the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, and addressing uncertainty, which does not alter our results.

Whereas previous papers assume learning from one observation per period, or experiment with control variables to gain additional information, this paper considers active learning from investment in monitoring, specifically in improved observations of the global mean temperature. We find that the decision maker invests a significant amount of money in climate research, far more than the current level, in order to increase the rate of learning about climate change. This helps the decision maker make improved decisions. The level of uncertainty decreases more rapidly in the active learning model than in the passive learning model with only temperature observations. As the uncertainty about climate change is smaller, active learning reduces the optimal carbon tax. The greater the risk, the larger is the effect of learning. The method proposed here is applicable to any dynamic control problem where the quality of monitoring is a choice variable, for instance, the precision at which we observe GDP, unemployment, or the quality of education.","[Hwang, In Chang] Seoul Inst, Room 418,57 Nambusunhwan Ro,340 Gil, Seoul 06756, South Korea; [Tol, Richard S.

The literature assessing climate policies has shown that assumptions regarding peoples' distributional preferences for climate change policy impacts are central for policy assessment, but empirical evidence for such preferences is lacking. We design a discrete choice experiment that varies how climate policies affect the income of future generations living in three geographical regions, with distinctly different current and predicted future income levels. The experiment is implemented on a sample of the Danish population and preferences are modelled in a latent class model. Our results show that a small majority of the sample (60%) hold preferences consistent with inequity aversion with respect to future income effects of climate policies across regions. For the same group, we find that preferences for co-benefits for current generations reflect a form of altruism, but not inequity aversion. In both cases, the altruistic aspects are moderated by an element of preferences for positive outcomes in own region too. The remaining classes display preferences with a varying focus on impacts in their own region or simply no support for further climate policy. Our results provide some support for the inclusion of social preferences regarding distributional effects of climate change policies in policy assessments, and hence for the significant impact on policy, this inclusion will have.","[Svenningsen, Lea S.] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Sustainabil, Lyngby, Denmark; [Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Thorsen, Bo Jellesmark] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate Change, Copenhagen, Denmark","Svenningsen, LS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Sustainabil, Lyngby, Denmark.",leasks@dtu.dk; bjt@ifro.ku.dk,,,Kobenhavns Universitet,Funding was provided by Kobenhavns Universitet.,,50,0,0,3,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The literature has emphasized the critical impact of modeling structures on the optimal climate policy. We estimate within a unified framework the comparative impact of modeling structures and investigate the structural modeling drivers of differences in climate policy recommendations. We use the integrated assessment model (IAM) RESPONSE to capture a wide array of modeling choices. Specifically, we analyse four emblematic modeling choices, namely the forms of the damage function (quadratic vs. sigmoid) and the abatement cost (with or without inertia), the treatment of uncertainty, and the decision framework, deterministic or sequential, with different dates of information arrival. We define an original methodology based on an equivalence criterion to compare modeling structures, and we estimate their comparative impact on two outputs: the optimal SCC and abatement trajectories. We exhibit three key findings: (1) IAMs with a quadratic damage function are insensitive to changes of other features of the modeling structure, (2) IAMs involving a non-convex damage function entail contrasting climate strategies, (3) Precautionary behaviors can only come up in IAMs with non-convexities in damage.","[Pottier, Antonin; Espagne, Etienne; Fabert, Baptiste Perrissin] Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Dumas, Patrice] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France","Fabert, BP (corresponding author), Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev CIRED, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",pottier@centre-cired.fr; espagne@centre-cired.fr; perrissin@centre-cired.fr; dumas@centre-cired.fr,"Pottier, Antonin/Q-1171-2017","Pottier, Antonin/0000-0003-2890-9585",,,,48,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1420-2026,1573-2967,,ENVIRON MODEL ASSESS,Environ.

Here, we compare the impact of these alternative representations of damage on the social cost of carbon (SCC). We ask whether damage on TFP growth leads to higher SCC than damage on production ceteris paribus. To make possible a controlled comparison, we introduce a measure of aggregate damage, or damage strength, based on welfare variations. With a simple climate-economy model, we compare three damage structures: quadratic damage on production, linear damage on growth and quadratic damage on growth. We show that when damage strength is the same, the ranking of SCC between a model with damage on production and a model with damage on TFP growth is not unequivocal. It depends on welfare parameters such as the utility discount rate or the elasticity of marginal social utility of consumption.","[Guivarch, Cline] Ecole Ponts ParisTech, CIRED, 45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Pottier, Antonin] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CNRS, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ,I3, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75272 Paris 06, France","Pottier, A (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CNRS, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ,I3, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75272 Paris 06, France.",guivarch@centre-cired.fr; antonin.pottier@mines-paristech.fr,"Guivarch, Celine/D-9772-2019; Pottier, Antonin/Q-1171-2017","Guivarch, Celine/0000-0002-9405-256X; Pottier, Antonin/0000-0003-2890-9585",,,,49,3,3,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1420-2026,1573-2967,,ENVIRON MODEL ASSESS,Environ.

This study shows how real options theory in combination with the social cost of carbon may help to calculate the value of information regarding equilibrium climate sensitivity and estimate the relative advantages of two different Earth Observing Systems (EOSs) for learning about ECS. One system aims to improve measurements of decadal global temperature increase and another targets measurements of decadal change of global cloud radiative effect.

Currently, risky levels of private and public debts coexist with vast amounts of savings that do not know where to go. Long-term climate-oriented financial products could enhance investors' confidence in low-carbon projects (LCP) and channel to them large amounts of private savings. The paper outlines a financial architecture, the cornerstone of which is an agreement on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) integrated into a project's appraisal and acting as a surrogate for a carbon price. This SCC would be the value of carbon certificates issued by the government and delivered to banks to issue credit facilities reducing the risk-adjusted costs of LCPs. These carbon certificates could be gradually transformed into legal reserve assets of the banks after verification of the reality of the projects. Finally, the paper considers whether such certificates would be recognized as genuine international reserve assets, backed by the rising value of carbon over time. It shows how emerging countries could then diversify their foreign exchange reserves through an asset based on the international recognition of climate as a global public good.","[Hourcade, J.

This resulted in a cap-and-trade approach which aims to mitigate the adverse effects on development through appropriate transfers to achieve fair burden sharing. However, the continuation of this paradigm cannot untie the development-climate Gordian knot. (The Gordian Knot refers to a seemingly intractable problem. According to a Greek legend, Gordios arrived in Phrygia in an ox cart, was made King and dedicated his cart to Zeus, tying it up with an intricate knot. The person who would untie the knot would rule Asia. Alexander the Great found a solution by cutting it with his sword. Hourcade et al. (The design of climate policy. MIT Press, Cambridge, p 408, 2008) explain that, after Rio Earth Summit (1992), the climate negotiations remained disengaged from the debates on development pathways, thus tying up a new Gordian knot of misunderstandings.) Instead one loses sight of the benefits of cooperation in a global agreement to abate GHGs emissions. The challenge is now to align the development and climate objectives taking into consideration the changing context since the 1990s which includes a re-equilibrium of the world economic balance and the adverse context created by the 2008 financial crisis. This paper proposes that carbon finance should be considered as part of a general reform of the financial system. The adoption of a carbon value as a notional price could trigger a wave of low-carbon investments in the world thereby redirecting some global savings towards low-carbon investments, thus providing a lever for equitable access to development.","[Hourcade, Jean-Charles; Cassen, Christophe] Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,EHESS,CIRAD, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Hourcade, Jean-Charles; Cassen, Christophe] CNRS, Delegat Paris Michel Ange, F-75794 Paris 16, France; [Shukla, P. -R.] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India","Cassen, C (corresponding author), Agro ParisTech, CIRED, Ctr Int Rech Environm & Dev, CNRS,EHESS,CIRAD, 45bis Ave La Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",cassen@centre-cired.fr,,"Shukla, Priyadarshi/0000-0002-7305-2907",Chair 'Modeling for sustainable development',The authors acknowledge funding by the Chair 'Modeling for sustainable development' (led by Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and Mines ParisTech).,,52,5,5,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

It does this by estimating the difference between the social costs of carbon (C) emitted and of costs offset by removal of C from the atmosphere by reforestation/afforestation. All current attempts to make forestry offsets more reliable focus on quality control rather than the mismatch of the timing of emissions and their offset. Recommendations that follow from the analysis are twofold. First, that markets for carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) removals by voluntary offsets should be confined to the annual incremental removals actually achieved. Second, the promoters of voluntary offsets projects should declare the annual stream of carbon credits and debits expected so that buyers can place a present value on such projects.","[Hunt, Colin] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Baum, Seth] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Hunt, C (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",colinhunt@bigpond.com; sbaum@psu.edu,,"Baum, Seth/0000-0002-2429-5232",,,,34,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

For an initial production of a stock of carbon-containing product, we can treat the release as a probability distribution covering the time over which that release occurs. The probability distribution that models the carbon release predicts the amount of carbon that is released as a function of time. The use of a probability distribution in accounting for the release of carbon to the atmosphere realizes a fundamental shift from the idea that all carbon-containing products contribute to a single pool that decays in proportion to the size of the stock. Viewing the release of carbon as a continuous probabilistic process introduces some theoretical opportunities not available in the former paradigm by taking advantage of other fields where the use of probability distributions has been prevalent for many decades. In particular, theories developed in the life insurance industry can guide the development of pricing and payment structures for dealing with the costs associated with the oxidation and release of carbon. These costs can arise from a number of proposed policies (cap and trade, carbon tax, social cost of carbon, etc), but in the end they all result in there being a cost to releasing carbon to the atmosphere. If there is a cost to the emitter for CO2 emissions, payment for that cost will depend on both when the emissions actually occur and how payment is made. Here we outline some of the pricing and payment structures that are possible which result from analogous theories in the life insurance industry. This development not only provides useful constructs for valuing sequestered carbon, but highlights additional motivations for employing a probability distribution approach to unify accounting methodologies for stocks of carbon containing products.","[Shirley, Kevin; Marland, Eric; Cantrell, Jenna] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Marland, Gregg] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Div Environm Sci, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA","Marland, E (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Math Sci, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",marlandes@appstate.edu,,,,,,15,5,5,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

In a two-sector economic model with endogenous growth, we construct a 7-dimensional nonlinear system and then linearize the nonlinear system to derive the expression of the SCC containing the damage function. We find that the selected damage function has significant impacts when we calculate the SCC. In our model, the long run SCC per unit of output is the discount flow of the damage function caused by temperature rise and it is also affected by temperature adjustment rate and some other parameters. The specific form of damage function directly affects the social evaluation of the externality of pollution. The concavity of the SCC in the time path depends on second derivative of the damage function in infinite time. Higher-order damage function increase the SCC. We find that when the society is in an optimal state, the long-term economic growth rate can still be guaranteed to be positive when the convex damage function is chosen. The key of mitigation and adaptation strategies is the development of effective climate policies. Thus, as global recommendations for mitigation and adaptation strategies, we recommendation policy makers to use a highly convex damage function to calculate the SCC. We suggest policy makers consider carbon tax policies based on SCC. This makes the economic view of pollution closer to the mitigation target of climate policy-makers.","[Zhen, Zaili; Tian, Lixin] Jiangsu Univ, Energy Dev & Environm Protect Strategy Res Ctr, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tian, Lixin] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Energy Interdependency Behav & Strategy Res Ctr, Nanjing 210042, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Tian, LX (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Energy Dev & Environm Protect Strategy Res Ctr, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Tian, LX (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Energy Interdependency Behav & Strategy Res Ctr, Nanjing 210042, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",lddcb@126.com; tianlx@ujs.edu.cn,,"Tian, Lixin/0000-0003-4817-8580","Major Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71690242, 91546118, 11731014]","This research is supported by grants from the Major Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos: 71690242, 91546118 and 11731014).",,39,0,0,6,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

The model takes account of climatic variables, including carbon cycle, carbon emission, climatic damage, carbon control, carbon concentration, and temperature. The results indicate that without optimal climate policy and action, the cumulative cost of climate damage for Malaysia and ASEAN as a whole over the period 2010-2110 would be MYR40.1 trillion and MYR151.0 trillion, respectively. Under the optimal policy, the cumulative cost of climatic damage for Malaysia would fall to MYR5.3 trillion over the 100 years. Also, the additional economic output of Malaysia will rise from MYR2.1 billion in 2010 to MYR3.6 billion in 2050 and MYR5.5 billion in 2110 under the optimal climate change mitigation scenario.

It compares the projections derived from the Dynamic Integrated Model of the Climate and Economy (DICME) based on the respective INDC and CV2040 scenario. The results reveal that industrial emissions would incur a substantial increase every 5years under the scenario CV2040, while Malaysia would experience lower industrial emissions in the coming years under the scenario INDC. Emission intensity in Malaysia will be 0.61 and 0.59tons/capita in 2030 for scenario CV2040 and scenario INDC respectively. Malaysia would face climate damage of MYR456 billion and MYR 49 billion by 2050 under CV2040 and INDC scenario respectively. However, climate damage could be much lower if the INDC regime were adopted, as this scenario would decrease climatic impacts over time. The estimated SSC per ton of CO2 varies between MYR74 and MYR97 for scenario CV2040 and MYR44 and MYR62 for scenario INDC in 2030 and 2050 respectively. Considering different aspects, including industrial emissions, damage cost, and social cost of carbon, INDC is the best policy compared to CV2040. Thus, Malaysia could achieve its emissions reduction target by implementing INDC by 2050.","[Sarkar, Md.

We characterize the strategic behavior in emissions mitigation and agreement participation with a potential climate catastrophe happening at a temperature threshold. Players are heterogeneous in a conceptual and two numerical models. We confirm that thresholds can induce large, stable coalitions. The relationship between the location of the threshold and the potential for cooperation is non-linear, with the highest potential for cooperation at intermediate temperature thresholds located between 2.5 and 3 degrees of global warming. We find that some regions such as Europe, the USA and China are often pivotal to keeping the threshold because the rest of the world abandons ambitious mitigation and the threshold is crossed without their participation. As a result, their incentives to cooperate can be amplified at the threshold. This behavior critically depends on the characteristics of the threshold as well as the numerical model structure. Conversely, non-pivotal regions are more likely to free-ride as the threshold inverts the strategic response of the remaining coalition. Moreover, we find that our results depend on which equilibrium concepts is applied to analyze coalition formation as well as the introduction of uncertainty about the threshold.","[Emmerling, Johannes; Bosetti, Valentina] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cam Biamenti Climat, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, Via Bergognone 34, I-20144 Milan, Italy; [Kornek, Ulrike] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer St 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Kornek, Ulrike; Lessmann, Kai] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Bosetti, Valentina] Univ Bocconi, Dept Econ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy","Emmerling, J (corresponding author), Ctr Euromediterraneo Cam Biamenti Climat, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm EIEE, Via Bergognone 34, I-20144 Milan, Italy.",johannes.emmerling@eiee.org,,"EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913",ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [336703]; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) program Global Change 5 + 1Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01LN1703A],"We thank participants at the FEEM Workshop on Public Goods 2014, the 20th Coalition Theory Network Workshop in Venice, the 7th Atlantic Workshop on Energy and Environmental Economics in Atoxa, two anonymous referees, Alessandro Tavoni, Henry Tulkens, and Philippe Colo for very helpful comments.

To date, energy efficiency improvement (EEI) has been broadly introduced exogenously in integrated assessment models (IAMs) by virtue of the autonomous energy efficiency improvement (AEEI) coefficient; however, it is usually good at capturing the EEI driven by non-price factors, while weak in describing the EEI induced by policy incentives. In this paper, we introduce an endogenous EEI (EEEI) mechanism in an IAM, called E3METL, to explore the impacts of EEEI on the global macro-economy, CO2 emission paths, and timing of carbon mitigations. The results reveal that (1) introducing EEEI significantly improves gross world product (GWP) gains, and this positive effect is partly offset when carbon restriction policies are implemented; (2) R&D investment dedicated to enhance energy efficiency limits R&D expenditures for other alternative technologies, and this effect will impede the development of non-fossil technologies; (3) EEEI may perform as one of supporting factors to delay the actions of carbon reduction; moreover, the introduction of EEEI lowers the optimal carbon tax level by 7.8 % on average, as compared to the no EEEI case.","[Duan, Hongbo; Wang, Shouyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gupeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Duan, HB (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",hbduan@ucas.ac.cn,,"Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project [14YJC630029]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71503242, 71210005]","Financial support for this work was provided by the Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project, No. 14YJC630029, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant Nos. 71503242, 71210005.

It is also shown how one can derive the end of the carbon era and peak warming. This simple arithmetic for determining climate policy is meant to complement the simulations of large-scale integrated assessment model, and to give analytical understanding of the key determinants of climate policy. The simple rules perform very well in a full integrated assessment model. It is also shown how to take account of a 2 A degrees C upper limit on global warming. Steady increases in energy efficiency do not affect the optimal price of carbon, but postpone the carbon-free era somewhat and if technical progress in renewables and economic growth are strong leads to substantially lower cumulative emissions and lower peak global warming.","[van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Rezai, Armon] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Rezai, Armon] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","van der Ploeg, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk; armon.rezai@wu.ac.at,,,,,,34,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1570-646X,1570-6478,,ENERG EFFIC,Energy Effic.,MAR,2018,11,3,,,,,627,639,,10.1007/s12053-017-9592-6,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX4OC,WOS:000426056700006,,"Other Gold, Green Accepted",,,9/30/2020

Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) are a widely applied policy instrument to improve the energy efficiency of appliances and reduce CO2 emissions, but they are criticized as redundant if an overarching carbon pricing scheme is in place. In order to better understand how MEPS could play a more effective role in reaching the 1.5 degrees C target, life cycle costs (LCC) for four home appliances were modelled considering a cost for emitting CO2. First, a significant social cost of carbon was introduced in a LCC optimisation model and it was found that a modest tightening of MEPS is sufficient to account for the climate externality. Second, more stringent MEPS were modelled and it was found that the switching prices needed to incentivize a shift up one or two efficiency classes were far higher than current carbon prices. These results have several implications for climate policy towards the 1.5 degrees C target. MEPS can easily internalize the climate externality and have the advantage over carbon pricing that policy makers can be certain that consumers actually move to more efficient appliances. While stringent MEPS do not appear to be economically efficient on the short-run, they are likely cost-effective in long-run 1.5 degrees C-consistent scenarios.","[Sonnenschein, Jonas; Richter, Jessika Luth; Dalhammar, Carl] Lund Univ, IIIEE, POB 196, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Van Buskirk, Robert] Enervee, 2100 Abbot Kinney Blvd, Venice, CA 90291 USA","Sonnenschein, J (corresponding author), Lund Univ, IIIEE, POB 196, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",jonas.sonnenschein@iiiee.lu.se,,"Sonnenschein, Jonas/0000-0002-8738-2704","Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten)Swedish Energy Agency [36936-1, 38263-1]","This research was supported by the Swedish Energy Agency (Energimyndigheten) through the projects 'Promoting ecodesign for the advancement of innovation, competitiveness and environmental improvements' (grant no. 36936-1) and 'Behavioural economics for energy and climate change policies and the transition to a sustainable energy system' (grant no. 38263-1).",,70,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1570-646X,1570-6478,,ENERG EFFIC,Energy Effic.,FEB,2019,12,2,,,SI,,387,402,,10.1007/s12053-018-9669-x,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HK5VU,WOS:000458037500003,,"Other Gold, Green Published",,,9/30/2020

Loss of mangrove biomass and subsequent potential emission of carbon dioxide is reported from different parts of the world. We estimated the loss of above ground mangrove biomass and subsequent potential emission of carbon dioxide in the Indian part of the Sundarban during the last four decades. The loss of mangrove area has been estimated with the help of remotely sensed data and potential emission of carbon dioxide has been evaluated with the help of published above ground biomass data of Indian Sundarban. Total loss of mangrove area was found to be 107 km(2) between the year 1975 and 2013. Amongst the total loss similar to 60 % was washed away in the water by erosion, similar to 23 % was converted into barren lands and the rest were anthropogenically transformed into other landforms. The potential carbon dioxide emission due to the degradation of above ground biomass was estimated to be 1567.98 +/- 551.69 Gg during this period, which may account to 64.29 million $ in terms of the social cost of carbon. About three-forth of the total mangrove loss was found in the peripheral islands which are much more prone to erosion. Climate induced changes and anthropogenic land use change could be the major driving force behind this loss of 'blue carbon'.","[Akhand, Anirban; Mukhopadhyay, Anirban; Chanda, Abhra; Das, Sourav; Hazra, Sugata] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, 188 Raja SC Mullick Rd, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India; [Mukherjee, Sandip; Mitra, Debasis] Govt India, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dept Space, ISRO, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Das, Abhishek] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Econ, 188 Raja SC Mullick Rd, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India; [Choudhury, S.

Oilrabia exports oil and buys final goods from the other country. Industria uses the carbon tax to impose an import tariff on oil and steal some of Oilrabia's scarcity rent. Conversely, Oilrabia has monopoly power and sets the oil price to steal some of Industria's climate rent. We analyze the relative speeds of oil extraction and carbon accumulation under these strategic interactions for various production function specifications and compare these with the efficient and competitive outcomes. We prove that for the class of HARA production functions, the oil price is initially higher and subsequently lower in the open-loop Nash equilibrium than in the efficient outcome. The oil extraction rate is thus initially too low and in later stages too high. The HARA class includes linear, loglinear and semi-loglinear demand functions as special cases. For non-HARA production functions, Oilrabia may in the open-loop Nash equilibrium initially price oil lower than the efficient level, thus resulting in more oil extraction and climate damages. We also contrast the open-loop Nash and efficient outcomes numerically with the feedback Nash outcomes. We find that the optimal carbon tax path in the feedback Nash equilibrium is flatter than in the open-loop Nash equilibrium. It turns out that for certain demand functions using the carbon tax as an import tariff may hurt consumers' welfare as the resulting user cost of oil is so high that the fall in welfare wipes out the gain from higher tariff revenues.","[Kagan, Mark; Withagen, Cees] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, OXCARRE, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England","Kagan, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.s.kagan@vu.nl; rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk; c.a.a.m.withagen@vu.nl,,,ERC Advanced Grant [269788],"We are grateful to the ERC Advanced Grant 'Political Economy of Green Paradoxes' for financial support (FP-IDEAS-ERC Grant 269788) and to Gerard Gaudet, Matti Liski, Peter Neary and Florian Wagener for useful feedback on an earlier version.",,24,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER BIRKHAUSER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, 6TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2153-0785,2153-0793,,DYN GAMES APPL,Dyn.

Because of the large uncertainties in the effects of climate change and the subjectivity of the discount rate, estimates of SCC range widely, from - 10.2 to 105 213$ t(-1)in 2010 USD. Despite this range, the SCC has been used or proposed as a basis for a wide variety of policymaking including cost-benefit analysis and carbon taxes. The SCC suffers from several practical and philosophical weaknesses: it is anthropocentric, it neglects the acidification of oceans, it assumes that quantifiable economic variables like GDP are the primary costs that humans will experience from climate change, and it is impossible to quantify objectively. Further, the ethical implications of a carbon pricing policy include both the value of the carbon price, and the use of revenues generated by the policy. Thus, revenue neutral carbon policies as in some SCC-based proposals, are unlikely to be just. Here, we propose that the cost of emerging negative-emission technologies would be an alternative means for setting a carbon price and avoid these philosophical and practical weaknesses.","[Snyder, Brian F.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA","Snyder, BF (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",Snyderb@lsu.edu,,,,,,60,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,1654-7209,,AMBIO,Ambio,SEP,2020,49,9,,,,,1567,1580,,10.1007/s13280-019-01301-y,,,14,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC7EE,WOS:000543444600009,31820259,,,,9/30/2020

Hundreds of higher education institutions publicly commit to carbon neutrality goals, pledging to reduce energy consumption, to invest in renewable energy, and to offset unavoidable carbon emissions, but these conversations sometimes insufficiently address carbon lock-in effects and their associated future costs. To our knowledge, researchers have not applied the concept of carbon lock-in to higher education institutions and their climate commitments. We hypothesize that carbon lock-in effects will present a major obstacle to achieving carbon neutrality and expose these institutions to significant carbon liability, even with aggressive emissions mitigation efforts. Examples of fossil fuel-consuming infrastructure on our own campus and scenario analysis of emissions from eight higher education institutions in Ohio support this hypothesis. We find that carbon offset purchases to eliminate lock-in emissions could cost these institutions tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Future regulatory penalties could impose similar costs, even on campuses without climate commitments. As a result, campus operations management should carefully consider further investment in carbon-emitting infrastructure, especially at institutions committing to carbon neutrality.","[Worsham, Matthew; Brecha, Robert J.] Univ Dayton, Hanley Sustainabil Inst, Fitz Hall Suite 665,300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA","Worsham, M (corresponding author), Univ Dayton, Hanley Sustainabil Inst, Fitz Hall Suite 665,300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",mworsham1@udayton.edu,,"Brecha, Robert/0000-0002-6716-6545",University of Dayton's Hanley Sustainability Institute,This work was funded by the University of Dayton's Hanley Sustainability Institute.

This has worked reasonably well as a resource allocation tool for conventional environmental problems, although not for climate change. Conventional economic analyses of the 2 degrees C stabilization target usually report modest benefits while costs are significant. Time lags and the discount rate eat up distant future benefits while present costs remain high. Modest estimates of benefits, based on expected value, do not reflect possible irreversible outcomes of climate change, and so the policy system tends to ignore these plausible conditions which are often statistical tail risks. BCA on tail risks would show benefits from acting, but typically, the costs might be shown to be much too high. When decisions made under high uncertainty have irreversible consequences, these consequences should be taken into account and properly priced. In this paper, we are proposing that the use of real options analysis can help us better understand values and costs of irreversible decisions and to value the costs of delay or early actions. Real options analysis is the most suitable instrument for estimating economic value of risk to be used in the BCA policy framework.","[Golub, Alexander; Brody, Michael] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA","Brody, M (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",agolub@american.edu; mbrody@american.edu,,,,,,21,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2190-6483,2190-6491,,J ENVIRON STUD SCI,J.

Our focus is on climate change: we build a very simple integrated assessment model, ie, a model that integrates the global economy and the climate in a unified framework. Such a model has three key modules: the climate, the carbon cycle, and the economy. We provide a description of how to build tractable and yet realistic modules of the climate and the carbon cycle. The baseline economic model, then, is static but has a macroeconomic structure, ie, it has the standard features of modern macroeconomic analysis. Thus, it is quantitatively specified and can be calibrated to obtain an approximate social cost of carbon. The static model is then used to illustrate a number of points that have been made in the broad literature on climate change. Our chapter begins, however, with a short discussion of resource scarcity-also from the perspective of standard macroeconomic modeling-offering a dynamic framework of analysis and stating the key challenges. Our last section combines resource scarcity and the integrated assessment setup within a fully dynamic general equilibrium model with uncertainty. That model delivers positive and normative quantitative implications and can be viewed as a platform for macroeconomic analysis of climate change and sustainability issues more broadly.","[Hassler, J.; Krusell, P.] Stockholm Univ, IIES, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hassler, J.; Krusell, P.] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Hassler, J.; Krusell, P.] CEPR, London, England; [Krusell, P.; Smith, A.

We describe the life cycle of wood products including forest growth, wood harvest and processing, and product use and disposal, focusing on the multiple roles of wood as both material and fuel. We present a comparative case study of a building constructed with either a wood or a reinforced concrete frame. We find that the production of wood building material uses less energy and emits less carbon than the production of reinforced concrete material. We compare the relative cost of the two building methods without environmental taxation, under the Current Swedish industrial energy taxation regime, and in scenarios that incorporate estimates of the full social cost of carbon emission. We find that the inclusion of climate-related external costs improves the economic standing of wood construction vis-A-vis concrete construction. We conclude that policy instruments that internalise the external costs of carbon emission should encourage a structural change toward the increased use of sustainability produced wood products.

Passenger cars provide personal mobility; however, they also have negative implications for human wellbeing from increased air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHG). Here, we evaluate the range of passenger vehicles available in the Indian market to identify options that minimize costs, human health effects and climate damages. Our approach is to compare alternative fuel/powertrain vehicles with similar conventional gasoline fueled vehicles and assess the differences in full (private and societal) costs for each pair. Private costs are the combination of capital costs and the discounted expected future fuel costs over the vehicle lifetime. The costs to human health from air quality are calculated using intake fractions to estimate exposure and literature values for the damage costs adjusted by benefits transfer methods. We use the Social Cost of Carbon to estimate climate damages. We find that, on average, the net present value (NPV) of the full costs of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles are lower than comparable gasoline vehicles, while, diesel vehicles have higher costs. Presently, electric vehicles have higher private costs (due to high capital costs) and societal costs (due to electricity generation emissions). Either a less carbon intensive electricity grid or an increase in the CNG fleet would minimize total costs, human health effects and GHG emissions from the passenger vehicle fleet. Policy makers should consider promoting the use of CNG vehicles, although this would require supporting infrastructure improvements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there exist several barriers, such as food vs fuel issues and technological constraints, restricting the sustainable commercialization of both first- and second-generation biofuels. Combining arable crops and their residues for hybrid first- and second-generation biofuel production provides opportunities to overcome these barriers. This study presents a high-resolution quantitative tool to support decision-making in feedstock production and sourcing for hybrid biofuel supply chains. We demonstrate this work with a case study on optimizing feedstock landscape design for a hybrid corn grain- and stover-based ethanol production system at Front Range Energy biorefinery, Windsor, Colorado, USA using a coupled simulation modeling and life-cycle assessment approach. The case study considered three competing design objectives including the minimization of feedstock-delivered costs, farm-to-refinery greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and nitrogen (N) leaching, subject to constraints in land use and biofuel feedstock demand. Social costs of carbon (SC-CO2) and nitrogen leaching (SC-NL) were used as weighting factors for GHG and N leaching in the objective function. Our results showed that marginal decreases of feedstock delivered costs (below $0.31 L-1), N leaching (below 0.44 g N L-1), and GHG emissions (below 125 g CO(2)e L-1) resulted in extreme trade-offs among the design objectives. Changes in feedstock landscape design were most sensitive to the variations of the SC-CO2 between $400 and $800 per Mg CO(2)e, SC-NL between $0 and $50 per kg N leaching, and their ratio between 0 and 350, respectively.","[Nguyen, Trung H.; Paustian, Keith] Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, 307 Univ Ave,Bldg Plant Sci C127, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Nguyen, Trung H.; Paustian, Keith] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Granger, Julien] Shell Trading US Co, Midland, TX USA; [Pandya, Deval] Shell Global Solut US Inc, Houston, TX USA","Nguyen, TH (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Soil & Crop Sci, 307 Univ Ave,Bldg Plant Sci C127, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",nguyentrung1710@gmail.com,,"Nguyen H., Trung/0000-0002-3528-4723","USDA/NIFA project [2011-67009-30083]; Fulbright Vietnam scholarship; Multidisciplinary Approaches to Sustainable BioEnergy PhD program - United States National Science Foundation; Hue University of Agriculture and Forestry, Vietnam (HUAF); Shell Technology Center Houston, USA","The work was supported by a USDA/NIFA project (grant# 2011-67009-30083) Decision support tool for integrated biofuel greenhouse gas emission footprints, the Fulbright Vietnam scholarship, the Multidisciplinary Approaches to Sustainable BioEnergy PhD program funded by the United States National Science Foundation, Hue University of Agriculture and Forestry, Vietnam (HUAF), and Shell Technology Center Houston, USA.

A set of optimal solutions is achieved and a final optimum point is then chosen using TOPSIS decision-making method. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the effect of variation of the unit cost of electricity on the achieved optimal solutions. While operating at the achieved optimum design, the variation of the exergy destruction of each component and the whole system due to the change in the cooling load has also been investigated.

We take as inputs recent estimates from the literature of the magnitude of the component aviation impacts and associated uncertainties. We then employ a simplified probabilistic impulse response function model for the climate and a range of damage functions to estimate the ratio of non-CO2 to CO2 impacts of aviation for a range of different metrics, scientific assumptions, future background emissions scenarios, economic growth scenarios, and discount rates. We take cost-benefit analysis as our primary context and thus focus on integral metrics that can be related to damages: the global warming potential, the time-integrated change in surface temperature, and the net present value of damages. We also present results based on an endpoint metric, the global temperature change potential. These latter results would be more appropriate for use in a cost-effectiveness framework (e.g., with a well-defined policy target for the anthropogenic change in surface temperature at a specified time in the future). We find that the parameter that most influences the ratio of non-CO2 to CO2 impacts of aviation is the discount rate, or analogously the time window used for physical metrics; both are expressions of the relative importance of long-lived versus short-lived impacts. Second to this is the influence of the radiative forcing values that are assumed for aviation-induced cloudiness effects. Given the large uncertainties in short-lived effects from aviation, and the dominating influence of discounting or time-windowing, we find that the choice of metric is relatively less influential. We express the ratios of non-CO2 to CO2 impacts on a per unit fuel burn basis so that they can be multiplied by a social cost of carbon to estimate the additional benefits of fuel burn reductions from aviation beyond those associated with CO2 alone (all else being equal). For a non-CO2 to CO2 ratio based on economic damage costs, we find a central value of 1.8 at a 3% discount rate, with a range from 0.6 to 2.5 for the upper and lower bounds of scientific and scenario-based uncertainty. Since estimating the co-benefits in this way is an important requirement for cost-benefit analyses, we also provide estimates of the air quality benefits of aviation fuel burn reduction in a similar format. We find the marginal damage costs of aircraft emissions below 3000 feet to be of similar magnitude to the climate costs on a per unit fuel burn basis, or an order of magnitude smaller on a per flight basis since we take no account of the air quality impacts of emissions above 3000 feet where the majority of fuel is consumed for the fleet.

If residues are combusted for energy, their carbon content is released immediately. Residues, that are not combusted, decompose and emit carbon gradually. The relative harmfulness of bioenergy emissions therefore depends on how strongly we prefer the slow release of carbon to an immediate one. Two factors affect this judgment: (1) our time preference and (2) our expectations regarding the relative harmfulness of future carbon emissions. Neither aspect is included in established biomass emission factors. The Effective Emission Factor (EEF), outlined in this study, includes both aspects in a transparent and tractable way. We demonstrate the concept by deriving the EEFs for the logging residues of three Nordic tree species: Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and silver birch (Betula pendula). We also examine the sensitivity of the results to variation in time preference and damage expectations.

Among others, it is argued to be based in a misplaced interpretation of policy for a complex climate-economy system as being analogous to individual inter-temporal welfare optimisation. The transfer of quantitative CBA and optimality concepts reflects an overly ambitious approach that does more harm than good. An alternative approach is to focus the attention on extreme events, structural change and complexity. It is argued that a qualitative rather than a quantitative CBA that takes account of these aspects can support the adoption of a minimax regret approach or precautionary principle in climate policy.

An alternative is to optimize abatement programmes towards a stationary state, where the concentrations of greenhouse gases are stabilized and shadow prices, including the rate of discount, are determined endogenously. This paper examines the properties of optimized stabilization. It turns out that the implications for the evaluation of climate policy are substantial if compared with evaluations of the present value of costs and benefits based on exogenously chosen shadow prices. Comparisons of discounted costs and benefits tend to exaggerate the importance of the choice of discount rate. while ignoring the importance of future abatement costs, which turns out to be essential for the optimal abatement path. Numerical examples suggest that early action may be more beneficial than indicated by comparisons of costs and benefits discounted by a rate chosen on the basis of current observations.

Its principal innovations are the treatment of global equity, calculation of the optimum interregional flows of resources, and use of McKinsey marginal abatement cost curves to project the cost of mitigation. The unconstrained, optimal climate policy in CRED involves very large capital flows from high-income to developing countries, to an extent that might be considered politically unrealistic. Under more realistic constraints, climate outcomes are generally worse; climate stabilization requires either moderate capital flows to developing countries, or a very low discount rate. In CRED, more equitable scenarios have better climate outcomes; the challenge of climate policy is to persuade high-income countries to accept the need for both international equity and climate protection. The paper ends with an agenda for further model development. A technical appendix describes the model relationships and parameters in greater detail. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

By inserting software switches to turn individual features on and off, we obtain FUND's estimates for 15 categories of damages, and for components of the agricultural category. FUND, as used by the U.S. government to estimate the social cost of carbon, projects a net benefit of climate change in agriculture, offset by a slightly larger estimate of all other damages. Within agriculture there is a large benefit from CO2 fertilization, a moderate cost from the effect of temperature on yields, and a much smaller impact of the rate of change. In FUND'S agricultural modeling, the temperature-yield equation comes close to dividing by zero for high-probability values of a Monte Carlo parameter. The range of variation of the optimal temperature exceeds physically plausible limits, with 95% confidence intervals extending to 17 degrees C above and below current temperatures. Moreover. FUND's agricultural estimates are calibrated to research published in 1996 or earlier. Use of estimates from such models is arguably inappropriate for setting public policy. But as long as such models are being used in the policymaking process, an update to reflect newer research and correct modeling errors is needed before FUND's damage estimates can be relied on.

Estimates of the SCC can be used by policy makers to evaluate climate change policies and greenhouse gas emission reduction projects by means of cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). Such analyses are complicated by the wide range of SCC values that have been reported in the literature, and the large uncertainties involved in estimating the potential economic impacts and related Costs of climate change. This study presents a critical review of the reported SCC estimates by examining some neglected consequences of climate change, uncertain and extreme scenarios of climate change, the discounting of future climate change effects, the treatment of individual risk aversion, and assumptions about social welfare. In view of the many uncertainties and omissions in conventional cost-benefit analyses of climate impacts and the SCC, alternative approaches to decision-making should be considered for climate policy.

Much of what it has achieved as a field of academic enquiry can be linked back to issues of integrated assessment modelling. This paper shows that the standard approach is going through a major change in scope as of the last five years. The conventional focus on determining optimal mitigation paths based on modelling the social cost of carbon is being enlarged to embrace promising new waves of research. These are: (1) the economics of insurance against catastrophic risks; (2) the economics of trade and climate; and (3) the economics of climate change adaptation.

In contrast to the literature that studies parameters of a particular social welfare function, such as the discount rate, we shift the focus and directly assume a parametric form for the intertemporal distribution of well-being. This has the advantage of avoiding explicit discounting choices, which has initiated much debate. Specifically, we consider a set of intertemporal distributions that reach a steady-state at a pre-specified level of sufficient well-being, or equivalently after a pre-specified end-of-growth horizon. We numerically illustrate our results in DICE and find that the social cost of carbon increases over-proportionally with the sufficiency level of well-being. While the social cost of carbon in 2015 is US$ 7 if the sufficiency level is four-fold the present level, it is US$ 30 if the sufficiency level is 15-fold, and US$ 100 if the sufficiency level is 26-fold the present level.

Carbon pricing can play a key role in meeting this objective. A cap-and-permit system, or alternatively a carbon tax indexed to a fixed emission-reduction trajectory, not only can spur cost-effective mitigation and cost-reducing innovation, but also, crucially, can ensure that emissions are held to the target level. The carbon prices needed to meet this constraint are likely to be considerably higher, however, than existing prices and conventional measures of the social cost of carbon. This poses issues of distributional equity and political sustainability that can be addressed by universal dividends funded by carbon revenues.","[Boyce, James K.] Univ Massachusetts, Polit Econ Res Inst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Boyce, James K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Boyce, JK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Polit Econ Res Inst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.; Boyce, JK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",boyce@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,81,31,32,6,49,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Consequentially, it is argued that cost-benefit analysis can suggest mitigation rates that are nearly arbitrary. This article investigates how firm conclusions can be made from cost-benefit analysis if the main uncertainties are considered endogenously in the analysis and an extensive sensitivity analysis is carried out regarding the contestable assumptions. The SCORE model is used to calculate optimal emission pathways and carbon prices that hedge against climate sensitivity and damage risks using a wide range of plausible parametrization. In a vast majority of cases the near-term emissions fall between 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C emission pathways, giving thus support for the Paris Agreement targets. Sequential decision-making allows hedging against uncertainties and readjusting mitigation efforts over time to reflect new information, leading to diverse stabilization temperatures in the long-term. Assumptions on mitigation costs, climate sensitivity and damages affect optimal near-term mitigation and long-term stabilization temperature more strongly than the discount rate choice. The consideration of parametric uncertainty on climate sensitivity and damages adds a substantial risk component to carbon pricing, while learning can induce significant price volatility in a decadal timescale.","[Ekholm, Tommi] Aalto Univ, Otakaari 1, Espoo 02150, Finland","Ekholm, T (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Otakaari 1, Espoo 02150, Finland.",tommi.ekholm@aalto.fi,"Ekholm, Tommi/B-6427-2015","Ekholm, Tommi/0000-0002-9124-6289",Nessling Foundation [201700487]; Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [311010],The research has been carried out with funding from the Nessling Foundation (grant number 201700487) and the Academy of Finland (decision number 311010).,,40,3,3,2,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The social benefits associated with carbon storage are estimated using the net sequestration rate and estimates of the social cost of carbon from the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE model). The net benefits of restoring wetlands in agricultural cropland are estimated based on these values and costs of restoration from the literature. The aim is to put a value on wetlands in Nova Scotia using original data rather than benefit transfers from other regions, thereby informing policy aimed at wetlands management in the region. Based on the results of this study, wetlands in Nova Scotia sequester 6.45 tCO(2)eha(-1) yr(-1) on average, and release 1.46 tCO(2)eha(-1) yr(-1) as methane. The total benefits of carbon sequestration in wetlands in Nova Scotia are roughly $124-$373 ha(-1) yr(-1), and range from $5105 to $39,795 ha(-1) in total. The social benefit of wetlands in terms of carbon sequestration is as high as $9.66 billion in Nova Scotia. Results indicate that protection of existing wetlands can be warranted on economic grounds.

This Monte Carlo analysis is, in essence, an averaged sensitivity analyses. The approach resolves all uncertainty before the first time period, drawing parameters from a distribution before initiating a given model run. This paper analyzes how closely a Monte Carlo based derivation of optimal policies is to the truly optimal policy, in which the decision maker acknowledges the full set of possible future trajectories in every period. Our analysis uses a stochastic dynamic programming version of the widespread integrated assessment model DICE, and focuses on damage uncertainty. We show that the optimizing Monte Carlo approach is not only off in magnitude, but can even lead to a wrong sign of the uncertainty effect. Moreover, it can lead to contradictory policy advice, suggesting a more stringent climate policy in terms of the abatement rate and a less stringent one in terms of the expenditure on abatement.

This note reviews the welfare economics theory fundamental to the estimation of the SCC in both static and intertemporal contexts, examining the effects of assumptions about the typical agent's pure rate of time preference and elasticity of marginal felicity of consumption, production and mitigation technology, and the magnitude of climate-change damage on estimates of the SCC. We highlight three key conclusions: (i) an estimate of the SCC is conditional on a specific policy scenario, the details of which must be made explicit for the estimate to be meaningful; (ii) the social discount rate relevant to intertemporal allocation decisions also depends on the policy scenario; and (iii) the SCC is uniquely defined only for policy scenarios that lead to an efficient growth path because marginal costs and benefits of emission mitigation diverge on inefficient growth paths. We illustrate these analytical conclusions with simulations of a growth model calibrated to the world economy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In comparison, the cost of climate policy consistent with the Paris Agreement target of 2 degrees C is about 1 percent of GDP. Thus, there is a strong case for the adoption of ambitious climate policy in India, provided other countries also adhere to the same.

The aim of this study was to analyze how disturbance-induced changes in plant species abundance patterns account for variations in annual CO2 sequestration flow (CS) of Mediterranean sand dune areas. Two sites characterized by a high (site HAD) and a lower (site LAD) anthropogenic disturbance level were selected. At both sites, plant species number, cover, height and CS based on net photosynthesis measurements were sampled. At the plant species level, our results highlighted that Ammophila arenaria and Pancratium maritimum, had a key role in CS. Moreover, the results revealed a patchy species assemblage in both sites. In particular, HAD was characterized by a higher extension of the anthropogenic aphytoic zone (64% of the total transect length) than LAD. In spite of the observed differences in plant species composition, there were not significant differences between HAD and IAD in structural and functional traits, such as plant height and net photosynthesis. As a consequence, HAD and LAD had a similar CS (443 and 421 Mg CO2 ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). From a monetary point of view, our estimates based on the social costs of carbon revealed that the flow of sequestered CO2 valued on an average $ 3181 +/- 114 ha(-1) year(-1) (mean value for the two sites). However, considering also the value of the CO2 negative flow related to loss of vegetated area, the annual net benefit arising from CO2 sequestration amounted to $ 1641 and $ 1772 for HAD and LAD, respectively. Overall, the results highlighted the importance to maximize the efforts to preserve dune habitats by applying an effective management policy, which could allow maintaining also a regulatory ecosystem service such as CO2 sequestration.

While there are numerous system designs and model formulations for minimizing electric bills under dynamic prices the use of these systems has the potential to cause an increase in emissions from electricity generation. The increase in emissions is linked to the difference in fuel mix of marginal generators throughout the day as well as inefficiencies associated with energy storage. In this work a multi-objective optimization model is designed to balance the competing goals of minimizing electricity costs for the home owner as well as minimizing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the operation of a BESS under dynamic prices. A total of 22 different regions in the US are analyzed. Optimizing only for energy cost resulted in an annual increase of CO2 emissions in all but two regions ranging from 70 to 2200 kg per household. The multi-objective model when using a social cost of carbon of 42 $/ton can be used to economically reduce these additional emissions in most regions by anywhere from 49 to 1450 kg of CO2 per year.

We construct a single-knowledge-stock model of R&D, growth and climate to assess the importance of this effect. The contribution of induced R&D is shown to be very sensitive to (i) the duplication externality, (ii) the feasibility of dedicated research subsidies to internalize inter-firm knowledge spillovers, (iii) the opportunity cost of R&D, (iv) the initial level of research expenditure, and (v) the elasticity of substitution between energy and other factors of production. In contrast, the direction and scale of the inter-temporal research spillover are of secondary importance. We find strong support for Rezai's (2011) argument that, when the business-as-usual scenario (no policy) is modeled appropriately (all externalities treated as external), sacrifices for early generations associated with optimal climate policy are minor or non-existent. Employing our preferred selections for the parameters, we find that adding an induced R&D component to the model increases the welfare impact of the first-best policy (optimally chosen carbon tax and research subsidies) by an average value of more than 400%, and of the second-best policy (carbon tax alone) by approximately 22%.

The evidence for selective reporting is stronger for studies published in peer-reviewed journals than for unpublished papers. We show that the findings are not driven by the asymmetry of the confidence intervals surrounding the SCC and are robust to controlling for various characteristics of study design and to alternative definitions of confidence intervals.

U.S. Department of Energy hourly residential profiles for five locations, 20 years of hourly weather data, prevailing electricity pricing rate schedules, and purchase prices and solar panel and wind turbine power output response functions, were used to address the objectives. Two commercially available household solar panels (4 kW, 12 kW), two wind turbines (6 kW, 12 kW), and two price rate structures (traditional meter, smart meter) were considered. Averaged across the five households, the carbon tax is expected to reduce annual consumption by 4.4% (552 kWh/year) for traditional meter households and by 4.9% (611 kWh/year) for households charged smart meter rates. The carbon tax increases electricity cost by 19% ($202/year). For a household cost of $202/year the carbon tax is expected to reduce social costs by $11. Annual carbon tax collections of $234/household are expected. Adding the carbon tax was found to be insufficient to incentivize households to install either a solar panel or wind turbine system. Installation of a 4 kW solar system would increase the annual cost by $1546 (247%) and decrease CO2 emissions by 38% (2526 kg) valued at $94/household. The consequence of a carbon tax would depend largely on how the proceeds of the tax are used. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The max-min or min-max regret climate policies rely on a non-sceptic view of global warming and lead to a substantial and moderate amount of caution, respectively.

Using data available for the Sacramento area in the United States for 2013, we estimate marginal emission rates of electricity and marginal price of electricity provided for charging PEVs at different times of the day. As the marginal emission rates and wholesale electricity price have different daily patterns, there is a trade-off between emission and charging cost. Moreover, the estimates in the literature of the social costs for the most important emission, CO2, vary substantially, implying that the social cost of charging PEVs vary with the assumed cost. Simulations show that the charging time of lowest social costs for PEVs is found to be at midnight if the social cost of CO2 is not very high (<$90/ton), however, we find this pattern changes with an increase in the social cost of CO2. A high price of CO2 tends to shift the time of lowest social costs of charging to other times of day, thus, charging at workplaces during the daytime rather than at home overnight can reduce the social cost of charging PEVs.

The national social costs of carbon of faster growing economies are less sensitive to the pure rate of time preference and more sensitive to the rate of risk aversion. The pattern of national social costs of carbon is not sensitive to the assumed impact function, climate sensitivity, and scenario, although the global social cost of carbon is. Income convergence raises the national social costs of carbon of poorer countries, and lowers them for richer countries.

The energy analysis indicates that when displacing a gas boiler, oil boiler, or electrical immersion heater, the SHW system would provide a net energy benefit for the majority of its estimated 25 year lifetime, thus enhancing energy security by reducing the use of, and dependence upon, conventional energy resources (mainly fossil fuels). A life cycle assessment was carried out to determine a range of environmental implications of installing and using the SHW system. It was shown that the use of aluminium has the greatest impact within the production of the system. During its use, the SHW provides the largest environmental externality benefits when displacing electricity. The economic assessment indicates that the SHW system is currently uncompetitive given the negative net present values of the various scenarios assessed. This outcome included the internalisation of the social costs of carbon. There are, however, future prospects for reduced capital costs that may significantly improve the economic performance of the system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Allen, S.

Then what is the optimal trajectory of carbon tax under various carbon-constrained scenarios, and what are the impacts of carbon controls on the economy and performance of carbon-free technologies are important questions to be addressed. We construct an energy-economy-environment aggregated model of China, combining top-down and bottom-up modeling and introducing revised logistic curves for enriching technical details. We also propose four carbon-constrained scenarios based on representative international carbon allocation plans. Our analysis shows that the optimal carbon tax in China is a monotonically increasing one, following a classical, S-shaped pattern. Carbon space constraints play an important role in promoting development of carbon-free technologies, while the substantial transition from fossil fuels to non-carbon energy would not happen before 2040, making clear that it will take at least 30 years to promote the development of carbon-free technologies. However, present energy-saving and efficiency-improving measures ensure that China is capable of achieving the voluntary goal of reducing carbon intensity in 2020 by 40-45% of what they were in 2005; nevertheless, introducing some carbon controls is necessary to fulfill the task of carbon emissions reduction in the Chinese Twelfth Five-Year Plan.

The impacts are manifested in performance measures like emissions, electricity prices, and electricity consumption. This paper presents an economic model comprising bi-level optimization and Pareto analysis. In the bi-level framework, the upper level models the operation of the microgrids and the lower level deals with electricity dispatch in the grid. The economic model is applied on a sample network in two steps. In step1, the bi-level model yields operational strategies for the microgrids and the corresponding values of the grid performance measures. In step2, a statistical analysis of variance combined with Pareto optimization attains guidelines for setting policies for emissions reduction and green penetration without adversely impacting electricity prices and demand. We conclude that renewable generation from microgrids can significantly reduce the negative impacts of the policies. Our economic model is novel as it 1) integrates operational strategies of microgrids and the grid under an emissions control regime, 2) explicitly considers social cost of carbon in the electricity dispatch, and 3) balances multiple objectives of emissions reduction, green penetration, and electricity consumption using a Pareto analysis.

If nuclear power plants retire, CO2 emissions in many U.S. states could increase, even while the states comply with EPA legislation aimed at mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. In this paper, we perform a Monte Carlo-based analysis to determine the breakeven price of electricity these plants must secure in order to avoid financial loses between 2015 and 2040, and find median breakeven electricity prices to range between.$35 and $73 per MWh. Based on our estimates of future electricity prices under a low natural gas price scenario from the Energy Information Administration, our analysis suggests that U.S. nuclear plants would require between $8 and $44 per MWh (median results) on top of electric sales revenue in order to breakeven. Assuming natural gas plants would replace retired nuclear power plants, we estimate an equivalent cost of avoided CO2 emissions to be $18-$30 per metric ton of avoided CO2 (median results) for multi-reactor nuclear plants, and $47-$97 per metric ton of avoided CO2 (median results) for single-reactor plants. Preserving the existing nuclear power plant fleet, especially multi-reactor plants, is thus a cost effective carbon-avoidance strategy compared to the social cost of carbon. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, blanket taxes applied to all industries in a country might not always be fair or successful in CO2 reduction. This study aims to evaluate the effects of carbon taxes on different industries, and meanwhile to find an optimal carbon tax scenario for Taiwan's petrochemical industry. A fuzzy goal programming approach, integrated with gray prediction and input-output theory, is used to construct a model for simulating the CO2 reduction capacities and economic impacts of three different tax scenarios. Results indicate that the up-stream industries show improved CO2 reduction while the down-stream industries fail to achieve their reduction targets. Moreover, under the same reduction target (i.e. return the CO2 emission amount to year 2000 level by 2020), scenario SWE induces less impact than FIN and EU on industrial GDP.

Most importantly, we demonstrate enormous sensitivity to presumed constant regional vulnerability and underlying assumptions about adaptive capacity. Manipulation of any of these parameters one at a time across reasonable ranges can diminish damage estimates by as much as 84% or, in the case of extending the time horizon with the Review's low discount rate, increase damage estimates by 900%. We also confirm the usual result that limiting atmospheric concentrations to specific benchmarks above 400 ppm cannot eliminate all damages. Nonetheless, we applaud the Stem Review author team for reconfirming that the climate problem can be approached productively as an economic problem whose solutions can be explored with the tools of decision analysis.

However, to date few estimates of the social costs of other greenhouse gases have been published, and most are not comparable to current estimates of the SCCO2. We construct an integrated assessment model that combines MAGICC and economic components from DICE to estimate the social costs of CO2, CH4, and N2O for the years 2010-2050, using assumptions similar to the recent U.S. government interagency SCC working group. We compare our estimates of the social costs for non-CO2 gases to those produced using the SCCO2 to value CO2-equivalent emissions, calculated using global warming potentials (GWPs). We examine the estimation error associated with using GWPs for single- and multi-gas abatement policies. In both cases the error can be large, so estimates of the social costs of these gases should be used whenever possible. However, if direct estimates are not available the value of reductions estimated using GWPs will typically have lower absolute errors than default estimates of zero, and provide lower bounds of the abatement benefits.

Since this price enters the investment decision process of regulated firms, this uncertainty increases the cost of capital for investors and might deter investments into new technologies at the company level. We apply a real options-based approach to assess the impact of climate change policy in the form of a constant or growing price floor on investment decisions of a single firm in a competitive environment. This firm has the opportunity to switch from a high-carbon dirty technology to a low-carbon clean technology. Using Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming techniques for real data, we determine the optimal CO2 price floor level and growth rate in order to induce investments into the low-carbon technology. We find that a carbon price floor can be used to induce earlier low-carbon technology investment and show this result to be robust to a large variety of input parameter settings.

The paper describes a simple probabilistic model of the costs of synthetic crude oil produced from Canadian oil sands. Synthetic crude oil is obtained by upgrading bitumen that is first produced through mining or in-situ recovery techniques. This forward-looking analysis quantifies the effects of learning and production constraints on the costs of supplying synthetic crude oil. The sensitivity analysis shows that before 2035, the most influential parameters are the learning parameter in the case of in-situ bitumen and the depletion parameter in the case of mined bitumen. After 2035, depletion dominates in both cases. The results show that the social cost of CO2 has a large impact on the total costs of synthetic crude oil, in particular in the case of synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen, due to the carbon intensity of the recovery techniques: taking into account the social cost of CO2 adds more than half to the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from mined bitumen in 2050 (mean value), while the cost of producing synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen more than doubles.

Energy is used in the production of the final consumption good. The energy sectors differ on the exhaustibility of the energy resource. Oil is an exhaustible resource, coal is an abundant resource, and a green energy sector uses labor. Oil and coal use increases the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, which generates a climate externality. Standard Pigouvian taxation prescribes that a uniform tax on all carbon energy inputs is optimal. This uniform tax must be equal to the social cost of carbon because this is the externality that the usage of these inputs generates. I consider a policymaker who cares about future generations and may discount the future less than the individuals in the economy. This paper's main theoretical result is that the uniform taxation rule does not carry over to an economy with a low social discount rate. In particular, the optimal carbon tax on oil does not equal the optimal carbon tax on coal. Moreover, while the optimal tax on coal equals the social cost of carbon, the optimal carbon tax on oil follows a more general formula.","[Elisa Belfiori, Maria] Pontificia Univ Catolica Argentina, Fac Ciencias Econ, Av Alicia Moreau de Justo 1400, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Belfiori, ME (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Argentina, Fac Ciencias Econ, Av Alicia Moreau de Justo 1400, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",elisa_belfiori@uca.edu.ar,,,,,,17,2,2,1,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,OCT,2018,121,,,,,,292,299,,10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.026,,,8,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GV3HA,WOS:000445983800030,,,,,9/30/2020

To this end, it proposes three dynamic schemes that can be implemented by the Danish government. In particular, the paper studies one Ad-valorem and two different per-unit tax schemes, which respectively depend on electricity consumption and CO2 emissions. A second contribution of the paper is to perform a holistic impact assessment based on six different categories, which decision makers can utilize to evaluate taxation schemes. These are: CO2 emissions saved; the social cost of CO2 savings; revenue neutrality; the composition of the production mix; transparency and predictability of taxation schemes; and how much consumption can be shifted. Based on the findings, a recommendation directed at Danish decision makers in the energy sector is presented. Results stand in contrast to earlier findings in the literature and suggest that a per-unit (excise) dynamic taxation scheme that depends on the level of consumption is preferred over a per-unit taxation scheme that depends on CO2 emissions or an Ad-valorem tax on the retail electricity price. This assessment is based on the considerations that the preferred scheme: (1) incentivizes greater demand-side flexibility, (2) reduces CO2 emissions more efficiently, (3) depends on a predictable random variable, i.e. electricity consumption.",,,Lau.Holm.Albertsen@gmail.com; madsbloend1853@gmail.com; boscan@sam.sdu.dk; aqs@mmmi.sdu.dk,"Santos, Athila/C-5089-2016","Santos, Athila/0000-0001-9126-9299",,,,26,0,0,8,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,AUG,2020,143,,,,,,,,111543,10.1016/j.enpol.2020.111543,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MA9CB,WOS:000542206600003,,,,,9/30/2020

Environmental economists model future costs and benefits of economic activities to compare them with the expected damage and mitigation costs of climate change. The wide range of their estimates reflects different model assumptions and controversial pricing of nun market effects. We do riot know, therefore, the significance of climate change, especially in comparison to other environmental and socioeconomic costs and benefits.

Published literature primarily focused on the SCC of CO2 emissions, neglecting other greenhouse gases (GHGs). The social cost assessment for other GHGs especially CH4 is also needed as it is the 2nd highest emitted GHG after CO2 with high global warming potential. The quantitative assessment of climate change damage per additional unit of CH4 can be termed as Social Cost of Methane (SCM). In the present study, the SCM (in CO(2)e unit) has been estimated for the Indian livestock using Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) and system dynamic approach. Different livestock growth scenarios viz. Business as usual (BAU), modified scenarios (MS I, MS II and MS III) have been proposed for SCM calculation (cost per ton CO(2)e CH4) through 2017 to 2032. The SCM for 2017 is $62-$1150 and is projected to be $77- $1438 in 2032. The highest SCM is in BAU ($1150 in 2017 and $1438 in 2032) and the lowest in MS I ($62 in 2017 and $77 in 2032). The differences in SCM values are due to the different population size of livestock and CH4 emission rate. Results and findings of the study suggest that the CH4 even emitted in small quantity has a significant impact on climate and hence should not be neglected in climate change mitigation policies. The SCM is a metric tool which helps to design the appropriate policies for reducing CH4 emission from livestock. The developed tool can also be applicable to estimate the social cost for other GHGs for market-based policy development.","[Kumari, Shilpi; Dahiya, R.

Here, we quantify the economic value of health impacts associated with PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursors (NOx and SO2) on a per kilowatt hour basis. We provide figures based on state electricity profiles, national averages and fossil fuel type. We find that the economic value of improved human health associated with avoiding emissions from fossil fuel electricity in the United States ranges from a low of $0.005-$0.013/kWh in California to a high of $0.41-$1.01/kWh in Maryland. When accounting for the adverse health impacts of imported electricity, the California figure increases to $0.03-$0.07/kWh. Nationally, the average economic value of health impacts associated with fossil fuel usage is $0.14-$0.35/kWh. For coal, oil, and natural gas, respectively, associated economic values of health impacts are $0.19-$0.45/kWh, $0.08-$0.19/kWh, and $0.01-$0.02/kWh. For coal and oil, these costs are larger than the typical retail price of electricity, demonstrating the magnitude of the externality. When the economic value of health impacts resulting from air emissions is considered, our analysis suggests that on average, U.S. consumers of electricity should be willing to pay $0.24-$0.45/kWh for alternatives such as energy efficiency investments or emission-free renewable sources that avoid fossil fuel combustion. The economic value of health impacts is approximately an order of magnitude larger than estimates of the social cost of carbon for fossil fuel electricity. In total, we estimate that the economic value of health impacts from fossil fuel electricity in the United States is $361.7-886.5 billion annually, representing 2.5-6.0% of the national GDP.

This paper examines the impact of employing a declining discount rate on the social cost of carbon-the marginal social damage from a ton of emitted carbon. Six declining discounting schemes are implemented in the FUND 2.8 integrated assessment model, including the recent amendments to the Green Book of HM Treasury (Treasury, H.M., 2003. The Greenbook: Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government. TSO, London). We find that using a declining schedule of discount rates increases the social cost of carbon estimate by as little as 10% or by as much as a factor of 40, depending upon the scenario selected. Although the range of plausible estimates is large, using declining discounting schemes in FUND 2.8 in most cases does not yield values at the 70 pound/tC level suggested by UK DEFRA [Clarkson, R., Deyes, K., 2002. Estimating the social cost of carbon emissions. Government Economic Service Working Paper. HM Treasury, London]. Indeed, only at the higher end of the values of social cost of carbon found here would many climate change related policies - such as the Kyoto Protocol - pass a cost - benefit analysis. This conclusion, however, does not necessarily undermine the ethical and political economic reasons for supporting international collective action on climate change. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimal climate portfolio is a mix of mitigation, adaptation, and SRM. When accounting for uncertainty in the magnitude of SRM side-effects and their persistency over time, we show that the SRM option lacks robustness. We then analyse the welfare consequences of basing the SRM decision on wrong assumptions about its side-effects, and show that total output losses are considerable and increase with the error horizon.

Firstly, we estimate the cost of baseline uncertainty from a decision maker's perspective using different metrics. Secondly, we discuss how measures of the costs of climate change induced impacts and climate policy costs can be compared under different and uncertain baseline assumptions. Given that policy costs and other measures such as impacts are typically expressed relative to GDP in a baseline, comparing those values with different baseline projections is not trivial. Finally, we compute the cost from baseline uncertainty which leads to a moderate increase of the welfare losses from climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We present two possible reasons for FUND's low damage estimates: the representation of carbon fertilization in agriculture; and assumptions about the extent of adaptation. We explore these issues in FUND 3.8, comparing the model's default results to scenarios without carbon fertilization and adaptation. We find that carbon fertilization is projected to provide a large net benefit, offsetting many of the damages in other categories; almost half of this benefit occurs in China, based on FUND's assumptions about the regional strength of carbon fertilization. Automatic adaptation, tied to increases in per capita income, reduces many damages, particularly deaths caused by climate change; almost three-fourths of the reduction in climate-linked deaths is projected to occur in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, many categories of damages are surprisingly small, a topic that warrants further research. As long as FUND's default forecasts remain significant in climate policy debate, it is important to understand the sources of FUND's low estimates of climate damages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As power plants fueled by coal and petroleum are phased out, other generation technologies must fill the gap. While technically feasible, many low-carbon technologies are currently expensive - though costs may fall with experience. As an alternative, natural gas-fired power plants provide lower-carbon electricity - and cheaply if gas is abundant. The least-cost portfolio of generation technologies depends on several uncertain parameters. This paper presents a stylized model of the global electricity sector and evaluates several decarbonization strategies focused on three bridge technologies - natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear - over the period 2015-2050. With constraints on total demand for electricity and penetration of renewables, I find that the results are sensitive to the learning curve for CCS, the cost of natural gas, and the social cost of carbon. Depending on the true state of the world, decision-makers may find either natural gas power plants or CCS to be least-cost options for decarbonization portfolios. The expected value of information from resolving uncertainty is hundreds of billions of dollars, indicating high social benefits from investments into scientific research.","[Wendling, Zachary A.] Yale Univ, Yale Ctr Environm Law & Policy, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Wendling, ZA (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Ctr Environm Law & Policy, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",zach.wendling@yale.edu,,,,,,90,5,5,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-6296,2214-6326,,ENERGY RES SOC SCI,Energy Res.

The paper examines the impacts of the shale gas supply on the U.S. energy security in the short and long-term future and will help guide policy making by identifying the extent to which climate policy can reinforce energy security objectives. The U.S. and other high-income countries face several long-term challenges relating to energy. One is climate change and another, also highly complex and controversial, is energy security. Energy security refers to the robustness, sovereignty, and resilience of energy systems. Energy security and climate policy are frequently presented as two aspects of the same issue. This paper evaluates energy security under long-term energy scenarios and provides analysis to help maintain energy security while meeting other energy challenges. The framework considers vulnerability as a combination of risks associated with energy trade and resilience reflected in diversity of energy sources and technologies. We apply this framework to five scenarios modeled with MARKAL: reference, high shale gas reserves, restricted access to shale gas, CO2 taxes that are equal to Social Costs of Carbon (SCC) and environmental regulation in power sector. Scenarios with high shale reserves and scenario with power sector regulations are associated with lower diversity of energy options. A few risks do emerge under CO2 taxes scenario after 2030 that include potentially high inter-regional trade in natural gas and electricity and low diversity of electricity sources. Net import is lower in the high shale reserves scenario while diversity is higher in a scenario that limits the shale reserves development.

The optimal carbon tax should include an additional component on top of the conventional present discounted value of marginal global warming damages. This component increases with the sensitivity of the hazard to temperature or the stock of atmospheric carbon. If the hazard of a catastrophe is constant, no correction is needed of the usual Pigouvian tax. The results are applied to a tipping point resulting from an abrupt and irreversible release of greenhouse gases from the ocean floors and surface of the earth, which set in motion a positive feedback loop. Convex enough hazard functions cause overshooting of the carbon tax, but a linear hazard function gives rise to undershooting.

We develop a dynamic two-region model, in which each region suffers from global warming, but also has an inequality aversion over current consumption allocations. Inequality aversion generally lifts the consumption path of the poor region, while the rich region must take a greater share of the climate burden. Furthermore, with inequality aversion, the optimal climate policy generally leads to higher investment in clean capital in the North and in dirty capital in the South, thereby allowing the South to pollute more and develop faster. The optimal policy may even require the poor region to increase emissions relative to the uncoordinated Business-as-Usual case. Introducing local pollution and transfers confirm the main results.

At the same time, long-run economic growth is highly uncertain. This paper is the first to evaluate optimal mitigation policy under long-term growth uncertainty in a stochastic integrated assessment model of climate change. The sign and magnitude of the impact depend on preference characteristics and on how damages scale with production. We explain the different mechanisms driving optimal mitigation under certain growth, under uncertain technological progress in the discounted expected utility model, and under uncertain technological progress in a more comprehensive asset pricing model based on Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences. In the latter framework, the dominating uncertainty impact has the opposite sign of a deterministic growth impact; the sign switch results from an endogenous pessimism weighting.

However, natural regeneration entails synergies and trade-offs across ESs and across stakeholders. To evaluate these trade-offs, we assessed the economic value of four ESs along the course of a natural regeneration process of tropical dry forests of the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and examined how this can inform the design of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes incentivizing forest restoration. We estimated the monetary value of two provisioning ESs -forest products and fodder for calves-, using contingent valuation and direct market valuation methods, and two regulating ESs -carbon stocks and carbon sinks- using the voluntary carbon market prices and the social cost of carbon. We assessed these ESs in four natural regeneration stages: pasture, young secondary forest (0 to 12 years of natural regeneration), intermediate secondary forest (between 12 and 25 years of natural regeneration), and old-growth forest (more than 25 years of natural regeneration or primary forests). Results indicate that throughout the course of the natural regeneration process, there are changes in the magnitude of the trade-offs between regulating and provisioning ESs. We find a clear trade-off between regulating and provisioning ESs in the early stages of natural regeneration. However, as secondary forests grow older provisioning ESs recover, creating synergies rather than trade-offs in later stages of natural regeneration. Our results suggest a PES aiming to increase climate regulation services should focus on the carbon sink potential of young and intermediate secondary forests, as this would provide the greatest additionality and mitigation. We also showed the relevance of using a portfolio of economic valuation methods that can include a wider range of values for understanding landholders' preferences. While with direct market valuation methods we found that young secondary forests have the lowest economic value as compared to other natural regeneration stages, contingent valuation showed that landholders value young secondary forests the most because of their potential - future - land use (i.e. the possibility of converting it back to pasture).","[Naime, Julia] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Naime, Julia; Mora, Francisco; Sanchez-Martinez, Mauricio; Arreola, Felipe; Balvanera, Patricia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad IIES, Antigua Carretera Patzcuaro 8701, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; [Balvanera, Patricia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Estudios Terr, Reforma S-N Ctr, Oaxaca 68000, Oaxaca, Mexico","Naime, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway.",junaime@nmbu.no,,"Mora Ardila, Francisco/0000-0003-0390-0189; Naime, Julia/0000-0003-0998-0984","Mexican National Council for Science and TechnologyConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [SEP-CONACyT/2009-129740, SEP-CONACyT/2015-255544]; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de MexicoUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT IN211114, PAPIIT-UNAM IN211417 2017]","This research was funded by the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology [grant numbers SEP-CONACyT/2009-129740 and SEP-CONACyT/2015-255544] and by the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [grant numbers UNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT IN211114 and PAPIIT-UNAM IN211417 2017].

Major increases in sea level would likely be driven by the melting or collapse of major ice sheets. This possibility has implications for the social cost of carbon dioxide, which is a key policy value as well as a useful summary measure of damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions. This paper extends earlier work on the importance of low-probability, high-impact events for the social cost of carbon dioxide to incorporate the possibility of extreme sea-level rise. To estimate its impact, an integrated assessment model is used, which allows a probabilistic assessment of climate change damages based on the linkages between the economic and climate systems. In the model, the generic discontinuity damage is replaced with the possibility of large-scale damage from factors that are taken to be correlated with temperature rise and, crucially for this paper, explicit consideration of extreme sea-level rise. Estimates of the amount of increase in the social cost of carbon dioxide that can be expected from incorporating extreme sea-level rise show that the increase is significant, though not especially large in percentage terms. The paper contributes to the literature of how to represent uncertain climate impacts in integrated assessment models and the associated estimation of the social cost of carbon dioxide.

Among the most crucial factors is society's willingness to tolerate potentially catastrophic environmental risks. To explore this issue, the present analysis employs a stochastic climate-economy model that accounts for uncertainties in baseline economic growth, baseline emissions, greenhouse gas mitigation costs, carbon cycling, climate sensitivity, and climate change damages. In this model, preferences are specified to reflect the high degree of risk aversion revealed by private investment decisions, signaled by the large observed gap between the average rates of return paid by safe and risky financial instruments. In contrast, most climate-economy models assume much lower risk aversion. Given high risk aversion, the analysis finds that investment in climate stabilization yields especially large net benefits by forestalling low-probability threats to long-run human well-being. Accordingly, the social cost of carbon attains the markedly high value of $25,700 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in a baseline scenario in which emissions are unregulated. This value falls to just $4 per ton as the stringency of control measures is successively increased. These results cast doubt on the idea that the social cost of carbon takes on a uniquely defined, objective value that is independent of policy decisions. This does not, however, rule out the use of carbon prices to achieve the benefits of climate stabilization using least-cost mitigation measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a novel contribution to the valuation of carbon sequestration services in marine ecosystems with an application to the Mediterranean Sea. We combine a state-of-the-art biogeochemical model with various estimates of the social cost of carbon emissions to provide a spatially explicit characterization of the current flow of values that are attributable to the various sequestration processes, including the biological component. Using conservative estimates of the social cost of carbon, we evaluate the carbon sequestration value flows over the entire basin to range between 127 and 1722 million (sic)/year. Values per unit area range from 135 to 1000 (sic)/km(2) year, with the exclusive economic zone of some countries acting as net carbon sources. Whereas the contribution of physical processes can be either positive or negative, also depending on the properties of incoming Atlantic water, the contribution of biological processes to the marine blue carbon sequestration is always positive, and found to range between 100 to 1500 million (sic)/year for the whole basin.

Although the use of SCC is very extensive, its predictions are very difficult. Because the SCC is defined by social welfare associated with economic growth and population, its estimation is necessarily dependent on future assumptions that are difficult to project. Many approaches consider the impact of population or economic growth on the SCC, but these socioeconomic factors must be grounded on solid assumptions concerning political, technological and environmental developments. Over the past seven years, the climate change research community has established five plausible socioeconomic narratives, called 'Shared Socioeconomic Pathways' (SSPs), numbered SSP1-SSP5. These scenarios provide descriptions of how the future might unfold in several key areas. To this end, we use the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE) to update the SCC under the five socioeconomic pathways, while also considering alternative damage functions and the social welfare discount rate to address uncertainty. The result of the China Climate Change integrated assessment model (C(3)IAM) were used to re-estimate parameters in DICE, therefore characterize the SSPs. The results show that, in a world developing towards regional rivalry (SSP3), the SCC today will likely double compared with other scenarios. If emerged developing countries will follow the same path as previous industrializations (SSP5), the SCC will experience a rapid increase after 2060. Inequality (SSP4) will experience low mitigation pressure under a sustainable development scenario (SSP1), while the historical development pattern (SSP2) will have a moderate SCC with higher uncertainty. The results can provide carbon price benchmarks for policy makers who hold different attitudes towards the future and can help address the need to avoid regional rivalries and fossil-fueled development, which may counteract mitigation efforts.","[Yang, Pu; Yao, Yun-Fei; Cao, Yun-Fei; Liao, Hua; Yu, Bi-Ying; Liang, Qiao-Mei; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Pu; Mi, Zhifu; Coffman, D'Maris] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London WC1E 7HB, England; [Yao, Yun-Fei] Sinopec, Sinopec Res Inst Petr Engn, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yun-Fei; Liao, Hua; Yu, Bi-Ying; Liang, Qiao-Mei; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yun-Fei; Liao, Hua; Yu, Bi-Ying; Liang, Qiao-Mei; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yun-Fei; Liao, Hua; Yu, Bi-Ying; Liang, Qiao-Mei; Wei, Yi-Ming] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Wei, YM (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.; Mi, ZF (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London WC1E 7HB, England.",Z.Mi@ucl.ac.uk; wei@bit.edu.cn,"Yang, Pu/P-1074-2019; Mi, Zhifu/P-1027-2019","Yang, Pu/0000-0002-9902-4322; Mi, Zhifu/0000-0001-8106-0694","National Key RD Program [2016YFA0602603]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71521002, 71642004, 71673026]","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the National Key R&D Program (Grant No. 2016YFA0602603), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71521002, 71642004, 71673026).

It is also dear that CO2 emissions are still too cheap and must be priced higher to sufficiently curtail emissions. Yet how high should a carbon tax be? Answering this question requires scientific insights on the costs and benefits of a carbon tax but also ethical and thus political judgements on how we value the damages from climate change that will happen in the near and in the far future. This paper discusses the key tradeoffs for policy makers, reviews the evidence on the social cost of carbon, and discusses global and unilateral policy options. It finds that a price of $77 per metric ton of carbon is defensible if we give 95% weight to damages occurring two generations (or 50 years) from now but higher if we want to further reduce the risk of catastrophic change. It is best implemented as part of trade agreements and in combination with R&D investment.","[Poelhekke, Steven] Univ Auckland, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; [Poelhekke, Steven] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Munich, Germany; [Poelhekke, Steven] CESifo, Munich, Germany","Poelhekke, S (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Owen G Glenn Bldg,12 Grafton Rd, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.; Poelhekke, S (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Munich, Germany.; Poelhekke, S (corresponding author), CESifo, Munich, Germany.",steven.poelhekke@auckland.ac.nz,,,,,,40,0,0,1,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2405-8440,,,HELIYON,Heliyon,NOV,2019,5,11,,,,,,,e02936,10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02936,,,5,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,JS8CO,WOS:000500530100164,31844775,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/30/2020

For example, the dollar value of carbon dioxide emissions due to anthropogenic climate damages, known as the social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), can be computed via the widely used DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) JAM by solving an open-loop optimal control problem. The results of such an open-loop decision-making strategy, however, do not fully reflect the impacts of uncertainty in the dynamic response of the global climatic system to radiative forcing. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the DICE JAM based on model predictive control (MPC). This MPC-based approach draws a clear distinction between the climate model used by DICE for mitigation planning purposes, and the true global climate herein captured by a low-order emulation of a model drawn from a state-of-the-art climate model ensemble (CMIP5, the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). The closed-loop control methodology in this paper thereby quantifies the impact of parametric climate model uncertainty (plant model mismatch) on estimates of the SC-CO2 obtained from DICE.

The target hydrogen pathways in this study are H-2 via natural gas steam reforming (NG SR), H-2 via naphtha steam reforming (Naphtha SR), H-2 via liquefied petroleum gas steam reforming (LPG SR), and H-2 via water electrolysis (WE). In addition, the conventional fuels (gasoline, diesel) are also included for the comparison with the H-2 pathways. The life cycle costs of the target fuels are computed and several key factors are examined to identify the economical feasibilities of the target systems: fuel cell vehicle (FCV) price, social cost of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and regulated air emissions (CO, VOC, SO., NO, PM), fuel efficiency of FCV, capital costs of H-2 equipments at a H-2 fueling station. The life cycle costs of a H-2 pathway also depend on the production capacity. Although, at present, all H-2 pathways are more cost efficient than the conventional fuels in the fuel utilization stage, the H-2 pathways have lack competitiveness against the conventional fuels in the life cycle (well to wheel) costs due to the high price of FCV. From future scenario analyses in 2015, all H-2 pathways are expected to have lower life cycle costs than the conventional fuels as a transportation fuel. it is evident that the FCV price is the most important factor for encouraging the hydrogen economy and FCVs. Unless the FCV price is below US $62,320, it is necessary for the institution to subsidize the FCV price by any amount over US $62,320 in order to inject H-2 into the market of transportation fuel. The incentive or taxes on GHGs and regulated air emissions are also expected to effectively encourage the diffusion of H-2 and FCV, especially for the H-2 pathway of WE with wind power (WE[Wind]). The uncertainties in the fuel efficiency of FCV and the capital costs for H-2 equipment at a H-2 fueling station have little influence on the life cycle costs of H-2 pathways.

It is aimed to study and compare the performances of hydrogen production methods and assess their economic, social and environmental impacts, The methods considered in this study are natural gas steam reforming, coal gasification, water electrolysis via wind and solar energies, biomass gasification, thermochemical water splitting with a Cu-Cl and S-I cycles, and high temperature electrolysis. Environmental impacts (global warming potential, GWP and acidification potential, AP), production costs, energy and exergy efficiencies of these eight methods are compared. Furthermore, the relationship between plant capacity and hydrogen production capital cost is studied. The social cost of carbon concept is used to present the relations between environmental impacts and economic factors. The results indicate that thermochemical water splitting with the Cu Cl and S I cycles become more environmentally benign than the other traditional methods in terms of emissions. The options with wind, solar and high temperature electrolysis also provide environmentally attractive results. Electrolysis methods are found to be least attractive when production costs are considered. Therefore, increasing the efficiencies and hence decreasing the costs of hydrogen production from solar and wind electrolysis bring them forefront as potential options. The energy and exergy efficiency comparison study indicates the advantages of biomass gasification over other methods.

The social cost of carbon concept is also included to present the relations between environmental impacts and economic factors. Some of the potential primary energy sources considered in this study are: electrical, thermal, biochemical, photonic, electro-thermal, photo-electric, and photo-biochemical. The results show that when used as the primary energy source, photonic energy based hydrogen production (e.g., photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical method, and artificial photosynthesis) is more environmentally benign than the other selected methods in terms of emissions. Thermochemical water splitting and hybrid thermochemical Cycles (e.g. Cu-Cl, S-I, and Mg-Cl) also provide environmentally attractive results. Both photoelectrochemical method and PV electrolysis are found to be least attractive when production costs and efficiencies are considered. Therefore, increasing both energy and exergy efficiencies and decreasing the costs of hydrogen production from solar based hydrogen production have a potential to bring them forefront as potential options.

The presented model is able to determine proper crops for biohydrogen production, its possible applications and use as well as environmental aspects. A multiplicative decomposition method was designed to forecast future production and Monte Carlo simulation was employed in the model to evaluate the risk of estimations. From 2013 to 2050, the hydrogen production capacity could increase from 53.59 to 164.41 kilotonnes (kt) in Iran. The highest contribution to biohydrogen production (52.1% in 2013 and 73.3% in 2050) belongs to cereal crops including wheat, barley, rice and corn and the share of horticultural products including apples, grapes and dates is the lowest (2.7% in 2013 and 2.2% in 2050). For possible variations in the quantity of collectable residue and biohydrogen yield, the production may change in the range of 40.16% and 209.48% of the base value in 2013 and 41.64% and 233.18% of that in 2050. Ammonia production as nitrogen fertilizer and the area could be cultivated by that for each crop were calculated. The amount of natural gas saving and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using biohydrogen were discussed. Development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and their impacts on the environment and consequent social costs as well as the quantity of gasoline would be saved were estimated by 2050.

The transportation sector is known as one of the largest fuel consumers of the global energy market. Hydrogen can become a promising fuel for sustainable transportation by providing clean, reliable, safe, convenient, customer friendly, and affordable energy. In this study, the possibility of hydrogen as the major fuel for transportation systems is investigated comprehensively based on the recent data published in the literature. Due to its several characteristic advantages, such as energy density, abundance, ease of transportation, a wide variety of production methods from clean and renewable fuels with zero or minimal emissions; hydrogen appears to be a great chemical fuel which can potentially replace fossil fuel use in internal combustion engines. In order to take advantage of hydrogen as an internal combustion engine fuel, existing engines should be redesigned to avoid abnormal combustion. Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines could enhance system efficiencies, offer higher power outputs per vehicle, and emit lower amounts of greenhouse gases. Even though hydrogen-powered fuel cells have lower emissions than internal combustion engines, they require additional space and weight and they are generally more expensive. Therefore, the scope of this study is hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines. It is also highlighted that in order to become a truly sustainable and clean fuel, hydrogen should be produced from renewable energy and material resources with zero or minimal emissions at high efficiencies. In addition, in this study, conventional, hybrid, electric, biofuel, fuel cell, and hydrogen fueled ICE vehicles are comparatively assessed based on their CO2 and SO2 emissions, social cost of carbon, energy and exergy efficiencies, fuel consumption, fuel price, and driving range. The results show that when all of these criteria are taken into account, fuel cell vehicles have the highest average performance ranking (4.97/10), followed by hydrogen fueled ICEs (4.81/10) and biofuel vehicles (4.71/10). On the other hand, conventional vehicles have the lowest average performance ranking (1.21/10), followed by electric vehicles (4.24/10) and hybrid vehicles (4.53/10).

AYCTE operations exhibit a lack of revenue associated with each item served, since there is no per-item lost sales value incurred when demand exceeds supply; accordingly, the second objective of this research is to present a novel method for estimating shortfall costs in a setting with no marginal revenue per satisfied unit of demand. We examine empirical data from AYCTE operations at the University of Missouri's Campus Dining Services (CDS) to infer the per-item shortfall costs that are implied by CDS management's historical production decisions. Consistent with CDS management's stated aversion to shortfalls, we estimate shortfall values which are between 1.6 and 2.7 times larger than the procurement cost and between 30 and over 100 times larger than the disposal cost. Utilizing published estimates of life cycle CO2 and the social cost of carbon, we identify a per-portion environmental cost. We incorporate the environmental costs associated with wasted overproduction and the inferred shortfall cost estimates into a newsvendor model formulation, to identify new optimal production levels, illustrating this approach with application to a set of food items served by CDS. We find that optimal production levels are decreased significantly (18-25%) for food items with high environmental impacts (such as beef), and reduced less for foods with less embodied CO2.

We find that the scheme will not result in an efficient level of abatement and propose an additional measure that will incentivize in-sector emission abatement opportunities that cost less than the social cost of carbon (SCC). The proposed measure sets benchmark emission intensities (CO2 emissions per revenue ton kilometer) by route group and facilitates flexibility in meeting the benchmarks by allowing airlines to sell permits if they operate more efficiently than the benchmarks, and buy permits if they do not meet the benchmarks. The CO2 benchmark system could operate concurrently with existing measures to mitigate aviation CO2 emissions, will reduce the number of offsets needed to achieve carbon-neutral growth, and provide another (optional) lever to address fairness issues in climate regulations. Moreover, by providing a blueprint for other industries to price marginal emissions at the SCC, a CO2 benchmark system could preserve the 'carbon budget' for use by high-cost abatement industries such as the aviation industry.","[Winchester, Niven] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Winchester, Niven] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, 97 Cuba St, Wellington 6142, New Zealand","Winchester, N (corresponding author), MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",niven@mit.edu,,"Winchester, Niven/0000-0003-2703-4596",Litterman Family Trust,"The author gratefully acknowledges helpful comments and suggestions from Steven Barrett, Tom Kiley, Tim Letts, Bob Litterman, Brad Schallert, Philip Wolfe; two anonymous reviewers; and financial support from the Litterman Family Trust.",,25,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-6997,1873-2089,,J AIR TRANSP MANAG,J.

A number of estimates are available in the literature. Since these differ by several orders of magnitude, there is ambiguity and confusion about which to use. This review aims to give some guidance on this issue. The variation in carbon value estimates depends on several uncertain aspects - which will remain uncertain - including climate sensitivity, assumptions about future emissions, and decision makers' ethical standpoints. Hence, there is no single correct monetary value for CO2: it will depend on the ethical standpoint of the user. Due to this, estimates of social costs of CO2 emissions cannot be used for calculating an optimal emission level, although they can inform such assessments. It is suggested that marginal abatement cost values are used for emissions capped by binding targets in short-term assessments, and that social cost of carbon values should be used for all other emissions. Benchmark principles for choosing a monetary carbon value are suggested along with associated estimates. Depending on the choices made with regard to ethical standpoints and assumptions about future emissions and climate sensitivity, estimates can be significantly higher than the ones typically used in assessment tools today. The estimates need continuous updating, and there is need for better understanding and communication around the limitations and uncertainties involved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In an industry regulated by carbon tax policy, we consider two competing firms who sell ordinary products and green products respectively. In order to promote the firm who sells ordinary product to reduce carbon emissions, the government of China imposes carbon tax on the or- dinary products. For the government, three objectives are considered when it makes carbon tax policy. They are increasing the government revenue, reducing the government expenditure and decreasing the carbon emissions. For the firms, it is important to explore their pricing strategies taken into account of the government tax policy. To find an optimal carbon tax rate and to achieve the three objectives simultaneously, we consider this as a multiple criteria decision-making problem. Hence, we propose to use a centralized data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to solve it. We find that when one firm produces ordinary products and the other produces green products; the government may set a high tax rate. While when both firms sell ordinary products, the optimal tax policy for each firm is different and the government may impose a higher tax rate for one firm and a lower tax rate for the other firm.

We also consider consumer environmental awareness (CEA), which is currently growing, and we focus on the impact of CEA, retail competitive intensity and other factors on the optimal carbon tax rate and social welfare. We address the issue from the point of view of a policy planner whose goal is to maximize social welfare. Additionally, we consider two different market scenarios: a bilateral monopoly situation and a scenario with multiple competing retailers. In terms of the impact on pricing, the retail price and wholesale price increase with the carbon tax rate in both scenarios. The market demand for the retailer that sells a more environmentally friendly product relative to other competing retailers will increase with the carbon tax rate in the scenario with competing retailers. Additionally, the government's carbon tax regulation at the optimal tax rate can effectively improve social welfare when carbon emissions per unit of product are large or the price of carbon dioxide is high in both scenarios, regardless of the extent of CEA. Further, when the competitive strength of an industry in the retail market is high, the government can also implement carbon tax regulation to reduce social welfare losses. Moreover, compared with the monopoly situation, the intuitive carbon tax rate is closer to the optimal carbon tax rate in the competitive situation, and thus, it will be better able to reduce social welfare losses.

In the event of a disruption, the sustainability of a supply chain will be compromised as a consequence of attempting to quickly recover from the disruption with minimal costs. However, a balance can be achieved between sustainability and recovery. Companies can maintain its sustainability, while recovering its operations with a comprehensive analysis of the decision criteria for the intended system. This study presents a recovery model of a two-stage serial supply chain subject to supply disruption with consideration of safety stock and carbon emission. The system consists of a single manufacturer and a single retailer, while the carbon emission consideration is from the transportation activities during the recovery cycle. The model is capable of determining the new recovery schedule of the manufacturer and the retailer, the optimal safety stock level, and the carbon emission cost impact during recovery. The results show that for a range of short disruption periods, the optimal safety stock level is significantly affected by the holding cost values. Furthermore, the cost of carbon emission is dependent on the number of recovery cycles, the distance between supply chain entities, and the social cost of carbon at the time of the disruption. A comparison of two disruption scenarios with different transportation arrangement illustrates a solution for a better recovery plan with faster recovery cycles, lower total recovery cost, and without any change to carbon emission cost impact. This study contributes to the supply disruption literature with the findings on how safety stock and environmental effect consideration affect the disruption recovery decision-making process in term of lot sizing and transportation arrangement.

They use carbon taxes to discourage manufacturing that is not eco-friendly, and subsidizes to encourage low-carbon production methods. In this research, the evolutionary game theory is applied to examine the behavioral strategies of the manufacturers in response to various combinations of carbon taxes and subsidies considering that the manufactured products have no distinctly low-carbon characteristics. First, we developed an evolutionary game theory model of the interaction between governments and manufacturers based on static carbon taxes and subsidies. Then we examined the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) of the governments and manufacturers under different constraints. Second, we analyzed the evolutionary behaviors of the governments and manufacturers under three additional models: dynamic taxes and static subsidies, static taxes and dynamic subsidies, and dynamic taxes and dynamic subsidies. Finally, we used a simulation to compare the results of all the models to determine the optimal carbon tax and subsidy mechanism. The results showed that the static carbon tax and subsidy mechanism implemented by the governments cannot provide the needed positive impact on manufacturers decision-making. Of the three dynamic carbon tax and subsidy mechanisms, the bilateral dynamic tax and subsidy mechanism is more effective, and it provides more incentives for manufacturers to adopt low-carbon manufacturing. The carbon taxes levied by governments are proved more effective to encourage low-carbon manufacturing than governments subsidize the low-carbon technology. Manufacturers' behavioral strategy is influenced mainly by the governmental policies, to which governments also need to make some dynamic strategy adjustments in response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The social cost of carbon (SCC) is calculated by scientists to monetarize the incremental unit of carbon emission and is used to assess climate policies. This study begins with a review of current research on the SCC, followed by a discussion of the choice of models for the SCC. We give a list of advantages of disadvantages of each model and finally use a meta-analysis to evaluate the SCC from published research. The main findings were as follows. (i) Integrated assessment models (IAMB) are often employed to assess the SCC, research on IAMB was started booming in the 1990s and slightly decreased after 2012. (ii) The estimated SCC ranges from -50 to 8752$/tC (-13.36-2386.91$/tCO(2)), with a mean value of 200.57$/tC (54.70$/tCO(2)) and it equals to 112.86$/tC (30.78$/tCO(2)) with a PRTP at 3% in peer-reviewed studies. (iii) The estimated SCC is higher in newer publication year and in peer-reviewed studies, the same trend happens with a higher climatic sensitivity and employing DICE/RICE and PAGE. (iv) The pure rate of time preference (PRTP) is tightly associated with the estimated SCC, and a higher PRTP has a lower estimated SCC. (v) The outliers often appear without realistic scenario setting and in studies have not peer-reviewed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is an important standard for the formulation of climate policy. The uncertainty of carbon social cost is closely related to climate sensitivity, damage parameters, discount rate and so on. Previous studies have mainly focused on the consequences of climate change and the effect of social cost of carbon and welfare under different policies. Its research on the social cost of carbon has not included the evolution coefficient of carbon emissions, and it has rarely introduced the climate disaster damage function into the process of solving the social cost of carbon. This paper provides a simplified formula for the social cost of carbon. The model has a nonlinear processing of the carbon circulation system, which increases the nonlinear structure of CO2 emission potential. In addition, the model modifies the climate damage function, which adds additional losses from climate catastrophes. This paper analyzes the combined effects of several key sensitivity parameters, resulting in a fat tail distribution of social cost of carbon ultimately. It is found that the mean SCC of 2015 is 44.93 (sic)/tCO2 and the median SCC is 15.9054 (sic)/tCO2. Considering the possibility of extreme results and the impact of disaster risk loss on uncertain structure, the joint effects of damage parameters, climate sensitive parameters, and discount rates make the social cost of carbon as much as 2.8 times the median and fat tail effect is obvious. This brings uncertainty to the current emission reduction policies and abatement costs, making it more difficult to assess cost-effectiveness. At last, the paper evaluates the social cost of carbon under the base situation and low discount rate in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Globally, the solid waste sector accounts for 18% of methane emissions and 3-4% of greenhouse gas emissions overall. Waste handling and disposal systems in most large cities have largely been designed with minimal accounting of environmental issues. This study presents the Waste to Energy Recovery Assessment (WERA) framework, a new quantitative decision support model for initial evaluation and alternative comparisons of different thermochemical treatments of municipal wastes. The framework not only accounts for benefits through electricity generation but also accounts for emissions from facilities and the associated social cost of carbon in a cost-benefit assessment. The assessments are conducted with Monte Carlo simulations that explicitly account for uncertain factors such as future composition and generation of solid waste, technical efficiency of treatment processes, capital and operating costs, as well as future policies. The framework is used to study waste-to-energy (WtE) systems for Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Tokyo and New York. The results show that WtE systems can fulfill only 1.4-3.6% of 2014 electricity demand in the analyzed cases. Furthermore, the net present value for different technologies can be positive if collection fees and electricity rates (potentially set through feed-in-tariff policies) are sufficiently high. The analysis for Abu Dhabi and Riyadh also reveals that in a limited set of conditions (of technology efficiencies, and waste collection rates etc.) the WtE facilities can be self-sustaining investments.

In the ETS, the carbon price is the key factor determining whether the emission reduction target can be achieved. The optimal carbon price is the smallest marginal abatement cost that can achieve the emission reduction target. This study simulates the marginal abatement cost curves of different sectors in China's ETS and calculate the optimal carbon price of sector coverage scenarios based on the criteria that involve eight sectors in turn. The results show that the marginal abatement cost decreases with increasing sector involvement. The optimal carbon price to achieve the two intensity targets at the same time is between 345 yuan/ton and 1140 yuan/ton. From the sectoral perspective, the power sector undertakes the largest emission reduction, while the transportation sector is responsible for smaller emission reduction. China's ETS will cause GDP losses from 1.63% to 2.27% compared with the BAU scenario, but it can achieve CO2 reduction from 9.56% to 10.13%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, flare minimization during plant shutdown is a desirable goal towards economic benefit and environmental sustainability. In this paper, a systematic flare minimization methodology for an olefin plant shutdown operation has been developed. It includes three iterative stages: (i) steady-state modeling and validation to build the foundation of the dynamic modeling; (ii) dynamic modeling and validation to enable plant-wide simulations under designated plant control strategies; and (iii) plant shutdown simulation and optimization to iteratively examine, validate, quantify various flare minimization opportunities so as to identify the improved shutdown strategy. Particularly, dynamic performances of the critical equipment (e.g., the cracked gas compressor) has been thoroughly investigated to ensure the operating safety associated with the developed new shutdown strategy. Compared with the conventional plant shutdown strategy, the case study has shown that the new development can significantly reduce flared raw materials and emissions by 90.23%, which result in estimated economic savings by 91.03% and the social cost of carbon saving by 90.37%.

This paper constructs a two-country environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (E-DSGE) model to compare the optimal carbon tax rates between countries in noncooperative and cooperative scenarios in the presence of different economic shocks. Compared to those in the cooperative scenario, countries without cooperation would have an optimal carbon tax rate that increases less in response to a positive home-country total factor productivity (TFP) shock and decreases more in response to a positive energy price shock. Further, in the noncooperative scenario, the carbon tax rate decreases in response to the foreign-country TFP shock, but to a lesser extent than that in the cooperative scenario. Countries cooperation does not necessarily lead to a lower emissions stock. It decreases only in response to positive home- and foreign-country TFP shocks, and it increases in response to a positive energy price shock. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

For long-term problems such as climate change, this omission may be significant. In this paper, I modify the DICE model of climate change (Managing the Global Commons: the Economics of the Greenhouse Effect, MIT press, Cambridge, MA, 1994; Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming., MIT press, Cambridge, MA, 2000) to allow for induced innovation in the energy sector. Ignoring induced technological change overstates the welfare costs of an optimal carbon tax policy by 9.4%. However, cost savings, rather than increased environmental benefits, appear to drive the welfare gains, as the effect of induced innovation on emissions and mean global temperature is small. Sensitivity analysis shows that potential crowding out of other R&D and market failures in the R&D sector are the most important limiting factors to the potential of induced innovation. Differences in these key assumptions explain much of the variation in the findings of other similar models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We compare a carbon tax and a cap-and-trade scheme for the policy bloc, in either case accompanied by an efficient offset mechanism for reducing emissions in the fringe. The policy bloc is shown to prefer a tax over a cap, since only a tax reduces the fuel export price and by more when the policy bloc is larger. Offsets are also more favorable to the policy bloc under a tax than under a cap. The optimal offset price under a carbon tax is below the tax rate, while under a cap and free quota trading the offset price must equal the quota price. The domestic carbon and offset prices are both higher under a tax than under a cap when the policy bloc is small. When the policy bloc is larger, the offset price can be higher under a cap. Fringe countries gain by mitigation in the policy bloc, more under a carbon tax since the fuel import price is lower. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Since biofuel production competes for land with agricultural production, a carbon tax could increase land rents and raise food prices. This paper analyzes the welfare effect of a carbon tax on fuel consisting of gasoline and biofuel in the presence of a labor tax, with and without a biofuel subsidy. The market impacts of a carbon tax are also compared with that of a subsidy. Findings show that if a carbon tax increases biofuel demand, the tax interaction effect due to higher fuel prices is exacerbated by higher land rent and food prices and greater erosion of the carbon tax base. Thus, the second best optimal carbon tax for fuel is lower with biofuel in the fuel mix, especially if biofuel is subsidized. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Despite being controversial, this approach has influenced both the Inter-Agency Working Group on Cost-Benefit Analysis and the UK government's guidelines on discounting. We first clarify the theoretical basis of the ENPV approach. Then, rather than following previous work which used a single series of U.S. Treasury bond returns, we treat nominal interest rates and inflation as co-integrated series and estimate the empirical term structure of discount rates via the 'Fisher Effect'. This nests previous empirical models and is more flexible. It also addresses an irregularity in previous work which used data on nominal interest rates until 1950, and real interest rates thereafter. As we show, the real and nominal data have very different time series properties. This paper therefore provides a robustness check on previous discounting advice and updated methodological guidance at a time when governments around the world are reviewing their guidelines on social discounting. The policy implications are discussed in the context of the Social Cost of Carbon, nuclear decommissioning and public health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We then use the analytic formula to structurally interpret a distribution of SCCs from deterministic IAMs, and develop an analytical breakdown and quantification of how different sets of parameters contribute to the SCC distribution.

The certainty equivalent discount rate that often underpins this guidance embodies uncertainty in the primitives of the SDR, such as growth. For distant time horizons the probability distributions of these primitives are ambiguous and the certainty equivalent itself is uncertain. Yet, if a limited set of characteristics of the unknown probability distributions can be agreed upon, 'sharp' upper and lower bounds can be defined for the certainty-equivalent SDR. Unfortunately, even with considerable agreement on these features, these bounds are widely spread for horizons beyond 75 years. So while estimates of the present value of intergenerational impacts, including the social cost of carbon, can be bounded in the presence of this ambiguity, they typically remain so imprecise as to provide little practical guidance.

In other words, what is the 'climate beta'? In this paper we argue using a combination of theory and integrated assessment modelling that the climate beta is positive and close to unity for maturities of up to about one hundred years. This is because the positive effect on the climate beta of uncertainty about exogenous, emissions-neutral technological progress overwhelms the negative effect on the climate beta of uncertainty about the carbon-climate-response, particularly the climate sensitivity, and the damage intensity of warming. Mitigating climate change therefore has no insurance value to hedge the aggregate consumption risk borne by future generations. On the contrary, it increases that risk, which justifies a relatively high discount rate on the expected benefits of emissions reductions. However, the stream of undiscounted expected benefits is also increasing in the climate beta, and this dominates the discounting effect so that overall the net present value of carbon emissions abatement is increasing in the climate beta.

Moreover, optimal marginal abatement investment costs differ across sectors of the economy. It may be preferable to spend $25 to avoid the marginal ton of carbon in a sector where abatement capital is expensive, such as public transportation, or in a sector with large abatement potential, such as the power sector, than $15 for the marginal ton in a sector with lower cost or lower abatement potential. The reason, distinct from learning spillovers, is that reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires investment in long-lived abatement capital such as clean power plants or public transport infrastructure. The value of abatement investment comes from avoided emissions, but also from the value of abatement capital in the future. The optimal levelized cost of conserved carbon can thus be higher than the optimal carbon price. It is higher in sectors with higher investment needs: those where abatement capital is more expensive or sectors with larger abatement potential. We compare our approach to the traditional abatement-cost-curve model and discuss implications for policy design.

These policy instruments imply different transitions to the same balanced growth path. The optimal carbon price minimizes the discounted social cost of the transition to clean capital, but may prompt premature retirement of existing polluting capacities and significant private costs in the form of stranded assets. Second-best mandates and feebates affect new investment decisions without providing incentives to under-use existing polluting equipment. These instruments lead to higher discounted social costs, but smoother abatement costs, and do not result in premature retirement or stranded assets. A phased-in carbon price can avoid premature retirement but still result in stranded assets, that is in a drop of wealth for the owners of polluting capital.

But how should we estimate the SCC? A common approach uses an integrated assessment model (IAM) to simulate time paths for the atmospheric CO2 concentration, its impact on temperature, and resulting reductions in GDP. I have argued that IAMs have deficiencies that make them poorly suited for this job, but what is the alternative? I present an approach to estimating an average SCC, which I argue can be a useful guide for policy. I rely on a survey of experts to elicit opinions regarding (1) probabilities of alternative economic outcomes of climate change, but not the causes of those outcomes; and (2) the reduction in emissions required to avert an extreme outcome, i.e., a large climate-induced reduction in GDP. The average SCC is the ratio of the present value of lost GDP from an extreme outcome to the total emission reduction needed to avert that outcome. I discuss the survey instrument, explain how experts were identified, and present results. I obtain SCC estimates of $200/mt or higher, but the variation across experts is large. Trimming outliers and focusing on experts who expressed a high degree of confidence in their answers yields lower SCCs, $80 to $100/mt, but still well above the IAM-based estimates used by the U.S. government.

It seems that key economic models have greatly overestimated the delay between carbon emissions and warming, and ignored the saturation of carbon sinks that takes place when the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide rises. This has important implications for climate policy. If carbon emissions are abated, damages are avoided almost immediately. Therefore it is optimal to reduce emissions significantly in the near term and bring about a slow transition to optimal peak warming, even if optimal steady-state/peak warming is high. The optimal carbon price should start relatively high and grow relatively fast. (C) 2019 The Authors.

We also captured the effect of the consumption of energy on climate change for future generations through carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In order to estimate the depreciation of natural capital, the shadow price of water for agriculture, the economic damages from soil erosion due to wind, and the social cost of carbon emissions were obtained from the literature and applied to the SLB using benefit transfer. We used Colorado's total factor productivity for agriculture to estimate the value of time (i.e., to include the effects of exogenous technological progress). We aggregated the economic data and the depreciation of natural capital for the SLB from 1980 to 2005. The results suggest that GNRP had a slight upward trend through most of this time period, despite temporary negative trends, the longest of which occurred during the period 1985-86 to 1987-88. However, given the upward trend in GNRP and the possibility of business cycles causing the temporary declines, there is no definitive evidence of moving away from sustainability.

These results are primarily driven by their much larger estimates of environmental degradation. Unfortunately, when going over their calculations, I have come to doubt the main outcomes of their study due to two issues: CO2 damage values are over-estimated by a factor 13 as a mistake is made in converting damage costs expressed in dollars per ton carbon towards dollars per ton CO2.

This model was used to evaluate carbon dioxide emissions and operational costs under different scenarios in an apparel manufacturing supply chain network. The results showed that the higher the social cost rate of carbon dioxide emissions, the lower the amount of the emission of carbon dioxide.

Grazing diminishes aboveground carbon, creating a trade-off between these two services. Furthermore, saltmarshes are threatened by overgrazing. To provide saltmarsh protection and ensure the continuing delivery of ecosystem services, there is a need to incentivise land managers to stock environmentally sensible densities. We therefore investigated the possibility of agri-environmental schemes and Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to compensate for lost livestock revenue under reduced grazing regimes and provide carbon sequestration and other benefits. This is the first study to consider the benefits arising from a potential carbon market to saltmarshes, although similar schemes exist for peatland and woodland. We calculated the net economic benefit (costs of livestock production are removed from revenue) to farmers obtained from a hectare of grazed saltmarsh under low (0.3 Livestock Units per hectare per year), moderate (0.6), high (1.0) and very high (2.0) stocking densities accounting for livestock revenue, carbon benefits, and agri-environmental subsidies. We repeated the procedure considering additional benefits transferred from the literature in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services provided by protected saltmarshes. The net benefits were assessed for a range of market carbon prices and social costs of carbon, e.g. the opportunity cost of carbon for society. Applying the model to Scottish saltmarshes we find that the current range of market prices could prompt transitions from high to moderate regimes in areas where livestock value is low, however break-even prices for transitions showed high spatial variability due to spatial variability in livestock values. In some areas of the West Highlands, the break-even carbon price is negative, indicating that the current agri-environmental schemes are able to more than compensate for the lost revenue accruing to farmers by a reduced grazing density. However, in other areas, such as the Outer Hebrides, the breakeven carbon price is positive. Private PES schemes or increased public subsidies should then be provided to generate net benefits. It is reasonable to infer that a pure carbon market may have limited scope in incentivising consumers to buy carbon services, especially in areas with limited local number of buyers and corporates of small size. Under this circumstance, a premium carbon market offering bundled ecosystem services may help reduce grazing pressure across a larger number of Scottish saltmarshes, thereby providing globally important climate regulation services and at the same time protecting sensitive habitats.","[Muenzel, Dominic; Martino, Simone] Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Laurence Mee Ctr Soc & Sea, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland; [Martino, Simone] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, 290 Wentworth Way, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England","Martino, S (corresponding author), Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Laurence Mee Ctr Soc & Sea, Oban PA37 1QA, Argyll, Scotland.",dominic.muenzel@gmail.com; simone.martino@sams.ac.uk,,"Muenzel, Dominic/0000-0002-7158-7748",,,,84,1,2,6,58,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Ireland faces significant challenges in terms of emissions reduction and is well off course in terms of meeting binding European Union targets. Flexibility mechanisms will allow Ireland to offset 5.6% of its commitment via sequestration in biomass and soils and land use change. Agricultural emissions in Ireland are largely driven by livestock production. As such, the purpose of this research is to estimate the net GHG emission benefit resulting from a land use change with forest replacing livestock systems (dairy, beef cattle and sheep). We estimate the total carbon sequestration in biomass and harvested wood products, along with the total emissions avoided from each livestock system on a per hectare basis. In addition, the paper compares the social cost of carbon to the average income per hectare of each livestock system. Finally, a hypothetical national planting scenario is modelled using plausible planting rates. Results indicate that the greatest carbon benefit is achieved when forest replaces dairy production. This is due to high emissions per hectare from dairy systems, and greater sequestration potential in higher-yielding forests planted on better quality soils associated with dairy production. The inclusion of harvested wood products in subsequent rotations has the potential to enhance GHG mitigation and offset terrestrial carbon loss. A hypothetical national planting scenario, afforesting 100,000 ha substituting dairy, beef cattle and sheep livestock systems could abate 13.91 Mt CO(2)e after 10 years, and 150.14 Mt CO(2)e (unthinned plantations) or 125.89 Mt CO(2)e (thinned plantations) over the course of the rotation.

Regions differ with respect to their state of economic development, factor endowments, and climate damages and trade on global markets for capital, output, and exhaustible resources. Our main result derives an optimal climate policy consisting of an emissions tax and a transfer policy. The optimal tax can be determined explicitly in our framework and is independent of any weights attached to the interests of different countries. Such weights only determine optimal transfers which distribute tax revenues across countries. We infer that the real political issue is not the tax policy required to reduce global warming but rather how the burden of climate change should be shared via transfer payments between different countries. We propose a simple transfer policy which induces a Pareto improvement relative to the Laissez faire solution. A calibrated example quantifies Pareto-improving transfers between rich and poor countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The theoretical framework takes account of the dynamics and interactions of forests' multiple carbon pools and assumes an infinite time horizon.

At the same time we show that it could be a net social benefit from harvesting even if the commercial profit from harvest is negative. If that is the case, the optimal harvest age is decreasing in the social cost of carbon. (C) 2014 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

Among them is valuing social costs resulting from climate change, which have complex time profiles. Long-term cost streams are normally capitalized at the prevailing social discount rate. Controversy attends whether that rate should decline through time. If so, capitalizing the social cost of carbon becomes more laborious. With declining rates, capitalized social cost of carbon fluxes is not only higher initially, compared with the capitalized cost at a fixed rate: the difference also rises through time. Thus in forestry evaluations declining rates have a double effect, raising the social cost of carbon in later time, and discounting this cost and other values less heavily. Discount protocols of the UK, France and Norway significantly alter forests' profitability. An ordinary Scots pine crop without carbon values is loss-making everywhere, whether constant or declining discount rates are used. This is also so with a constant rate and constant carbon price. Declining rates bring about profitability in the UK and France, even with constant carbon price. Using declining rates to price carbon and discount cash flows brings further increase, doubling profitability with the protocols of the UK and France, and bringing about profitability with the protocol of Norway. Hence full application of declining discount protocols is not just a theoretical refinement, but significant for practical results.

We find that if only CO2 emitters are penalized, increasing prices to the social cost of carbon is sufficient to achieve a decarbonized system in the medium-term but not maintain it in the long-term. Unless carbon pricing mechanisms are adapted to remunerate CDR services, CDR technologies are not deployed. Incentivizing CDR could mean that lower levels of carbon taxation are needed to meet the Paris Agreement, which in turn lowers electricity costs.

This paper formalizes the broader policy implications of this approach in general equilibrium by characterizing jointly optimal environmental and fiscal policies in a climate-economy model with differential planner-household discounting. First, I show that decentralizing the optimal allocation requires not only high carbon prices but also fundamental changes to tax policy: If the government discounts the future less than households, implementing the optimal allocation requires an effective capital income subsidy (a negative intertemporal wedge), and, in a setting with distortionary taxation, an effective labor-consumption tax wedge that is decreasing over time. Second, if the government cannot subsidize capital income, the constrained-optimal carbon tax may be up to 50% below the present value of marginal damages (the social cost of carbon) due to the general equilibrium effects of climate policy on household savings. Third, given the choice to optimize either carbon, capital, or labor income taxes, the socially discounting planner's welfare ranking is ambiguous over a standard range of parameters. Overall, in general equilibrium, a policy-maker's choice to adopt differential social discounting may thus overturn conventional recommendations for both environmental and fiscal policy.","[Barrage, Lint] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Barrage, Lint] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Barrage, L (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.; Barrage, L (corresponding author), NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lint_barrage@brown.edu,,,,,,58,5,5,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

However, many forests are being degraded and their services have been undervalued. The main problem lies in the inadequate institutional arrangements for forest governance. This paper aims to assess the effects of alternative forest governance arrangements on the provision and economic values of forest ecosystem services (FES) in Vietnam. The study presents a framework for mapping land use and land cover (LULC) change stemming from actual and hypothetical changes in forest governance regimes, quantifies the resulting changes in the provision of FES, and estimates the associated economic values. In the context of the study site in the North Western uplands of Vietnam, we test three alternative forest governance scenarios: business as usual, with a dominant government role; a community-based governance regime; and a private, individual-based forestry governance regime. Scenarios are based quite closely on the way these regimes are (or might be expected to be) implemented in Vietnam. For each forest governance scenario, we map LULC changes based on land suitability analysis and transition likelihood for the period 2010 2020. The resulting maps are used as inputs into the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) model, which is used to estimate the quantity of three specific FES: carbon storage/sequestration, sediment yield, and water yield. We apply economic valuation methods to value these services: the social cost of carbon is used to estimate the economic values of carbon storage/sequestration; the cost of removing sediment deposited in reservoirs is applied for valuing the reduction of sediment yield, and the residual value of water supply for hydropower generation is used for valuing water yield. The results show that forest governance regimes have a significant effect not only on forest LULC, but also on the quantity and values of FES derived from forests. The FES are differentially affected by alternative forest governance regimes: some FES increase in quantity and value under some governance regimes and decrease under others. Of the three forest governance regimes examined, there is no one regime that will always be 'better' than the others in terms of provisioning all considered FES. For the specific context of Vietnam, we find that the private forest governance scenario is inferior to the community-based governance scenario, as an alternative to the current state-based governance. Because our results pertain to the scenarios as constructed, rather than generally to broad categories of governance regimes, there remains the possibility that regimes can be constructed that outperform all of those examined here.","[Nguyen, Minh Duc] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nguyen, Minh Duc] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Hanoi, Vietnam; Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Nguyen, Minh Duc] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Fac Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Hanoi, Vietnam","Nguyen, MD (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Nguyen, MD (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Hanoi, Vietnam.; Nguyen, MD (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Fac Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Hanoi, Vietnam.",nmduc@vnua.edu.vn; tiho.ancev@sydney.edu.au; randall.3@osu.edu,,,,,,161,3,3,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,SEP,2020,97,,,,,,,,103297,10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.03.028,,,17,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MY9NR,WOS:000558748500004,,,,,9/30/2020

The results showed that the meadows acted as a net sink of atmospheric CO2; however, they may also act as a minor source of CO2 to the atmosphere depending on the degree of anthropogenic influence. The mean ecosystem productivity ranged between 6.31 and 11.9 kg C ha(-1)d(-1), which is equivalent to the capture of 8.44 and 15.9 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). This captured carbon was apportioned primarily in sediments (129 Mg C-org ha(-1) in top 1 m soil), which was much higher than the carbon stored as above and below ground biomass (0.20-0.96 Mg C-org ha(-1) and 0.30-2.90 Mg C-org ha(-1), respectively). The economic valuation of regulatory ecosystem services in the form of C sequestration by an estimated 51,700 ha of total seagrass cover in India was largely dependent on the sequestration rates and the average social cost of carbon. The estimated values ranged between $ 1.02 million and $ 3.65 million per year. In addition, monetary values of the stored carbon in live biomass of Indian seagrass systems ranged between $ 0.45 million and $ 3.89 million, whereas, in the top 1 m soil it ranged between $ 109 million and $ 146 million. Detailed evaluations of various ecosystem functions considering the importance of the local variables may provide a better monetary estimate of these regulatory services.","[Ganguly, D.; Singh, G.; Purvaja, R.; Bhatta, R.; Selvam, A.

Employing per ton damage estimates for the co-pollutants produced by an integrated assessment model, co-pollutant damage estimates per ton carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) are developed for over 10,000 sources of GHGs in the lower 48 states including both transportation sources and electric power generation. For coal-fired electric power generation, the co-pollutant damages are larger in magnitude than recent peer-reviewed estimates of the marginal damage for GHGs. The co-pollutant damage per ton CO(2)e varies considerably across source types and source location. The paper estimates the welfare gain from adopting a policy that encompasses the spatially variant co-pollutant damage to be between $1 million and $85 million annually. The range depends on the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve. The paper also shows that a distortionary aggregate emission cap reduces the advantage of differentiated policy. Provided an excessively strict cap, the spatially differentiated policy may reduce aggregate welfare. This result has important implications for GHG policy in the United States: although co-pollutant benefits of abating GHGs have been shown to be significant in magnitude, tailoring climate policy to reflect these source-specific co-benefits is not necessarily socially beneficial. This bolsters arguments for upstream policy designs. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

Regulators offer agricultural producers payments to reduce their emissions for some price per ton relative to the social price of carbon. Abstracting from distributional concerns or costly transfers, we derive optimal contracts for offsets contracts, minimizing welfare losses from adverse selection. The model shows how the level of monitoring and the prices offered should vary depending on the regulator's information. Although existing and proposed policies discount the price that offset producers receive relative to the social cost of carbon to account for the adverse selection, our model argues that optimal offset prices may be above the social cost of carbon for sufficiently high levels of monitoring. Our model also identifies and quantifies the types of firms that produce additional offsets for a given contract, offering guidance on how regulators might better target offset contracts.

Lower gas prices also incentivized new investment in natural gas capacity. This less carbon-intensive capital stock led to an additional decrease of 2,100 tons/h in 2013.

However, with advances in information and communication technology in recent years telecommuting is becoming a viable option for employers and employees to undertake. This paper examines the current trends of full day and part day telecommuting in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), and attempts to ascertain the most influential drivers and constraints related to telecommuting. The research presented estimates of the environmental benefits from individuals that telecommute. Finally, this paper seeks to determine the magnitude of carbon emissions savings from individuals adopting telecommuting and provides a social cost of carbon saving value. The survey results presented suggest that approximately 44% of the population of the GDA telecommute at least once a month. The findings also indicate that needing contact with colleagues is the most influential constraint to telecommuting, while greater flexibility and avoiding travelling in peak periods are the most important drivers in the propensity to telecommute. Finally, this study shows that there are substantial carbon reductions and social cost of carbon savings.

Hence, investments in solar electricity generation projects in African countries have the potential to be economically attractive. This paper reviews the feasibility of off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in SSA, focusing on five major issues in the context of falling system costs: cost-effectiveness, affordability, financing, environmental impact, and poverty alleviation. Over time, solar PV system costs have fallen dramatically across the globe. This is also the case in SSA, yet the costs prevailing in SSA are much higher than the world average owing to political, financial, and technological risks. Solar PV power systems continue to be an extremely costly source of electricity for the vast majority of the rural poor in SSA. The levellized cost of energy for solar PV systems is high, at US $0.83 per kW h. With an annual rate of decrease of PV system costs of 4% and 7.67% it is estimated that it will take from 8.7 to 16.9 years for solar home systems for electricity generation to become competitive with conventional diesel generators. The cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through rural solar PV electrification is in the range 150-626 US$/tCO(2), which is extremely high compared with the current price of traded CO2 emission permits or current estimates of the social cost of carbon of approximately 39 US$/tCO(2). Off-grid solar PV systems are not feasible financially or economically for rural households of SSA unless these technologies are subsidised from abroad. If the policy of a country is to encourage rural electrification, it should carry this out through a systematic expansion of either local or national grids rather than household-level solar PV systems.

According to our results, the joint effect of (i) the value of avoided emissions due to renewable energy participation and (ii) the merit order effect was able to compensate for the regulatory costs (subsidies) up until 2010, while the sign of the net effect was reversed from 2011 to 2017.

Greenhouse gases, especially CO2, emitted from power plants are one of the most challenging problems facing societies. Estimating the real cost of such emissions should include both internal and external costs that include the social cost of carbon (SCC). SCC is usually estimated as the net present value of the climate change effects over the next 100 years of one ton of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere today. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has one of the highest per capita rates of power and water consumptions in the world which are leading to a large amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of the water production in the country comes from desalination plants that are energy intensive, hence the link between energy and water (the nexus). Thermal desalination technologies are the major techniques used in UAE, therefore, cogeneration-based power plants dominate the energy sector in the UAE. This nexus is resulting in a significant impact on the environment due to GHG emissions, as well as other solid and liquid wastes. This paper investigates the potential SCC in UAE from the year 2010 until the year 2030. Additionally, different mitigation strategies were analyzed to reduce SCC by including energy mix from conventional and non-conventional sources. It is estimated that by 2030 the total CO2 emissions will be around 139.252 billion tons from power generation and 18.8 million tons from water productions. SCC is estimated to be around 6.96 trillion dollars and 938.4 million dollars for energy and water productions respectively. With the implementation of mitigation strategies, the SCC can be reduced by 1.5 trillion dollars by the year 2030.","[Saleh, Layla; al Zaabi, Mohamed; Mezher, Toufic] Khalifa Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates","Saleh, L (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",layla.saleh@ku.ac.ae; mohamed.alzaabi@ku.ac.ae; toufic.mezher@ku.ac.ae,,,"Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, UAE","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, UAE.",,61,0,0,1,7,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the employed policies using the following criteria: 1) Did the policy achieve the objective of increasing production and consumption of the targeted renewable energy? 2) Did the policy reduce US dependence on foreign energy? 3) What was the cost of the renewable energy increase, and how does it compare with the government estimated Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) around $40/ton ($0.04/kg) or with the implicit SSC often associated with achieving the aims of the Paris accord of $160/ton ($0.16/kg) or higher? 4) What were the unintended consequences of the policy? The important conclusions are: 1) Policy makers prefer regulation to pricing mechanisms; 2) The success in achieving quantitative targets is mixed; 3) The social cost of achieving the renewable penetration is generally higher than the SCC. With the renewable energy growth required to achieve the levels needed to achieve the Paris accord, the unintended consequence of costs rise significantly with scale. Most of the analysis done to date has only examined impacts and costs at low levels of penetration.","[Herath, N.; Tyner, W.

This paper attempts to assess future SCC for eight Chinese regions by using the regional integrated model of climate and the economy (the RICE model), based on four scenarios, namely baseline (BS), carbon emissions trading (CET), carbon quotas (CQ), and carbon tax (CT) for the period 2005-2050. The results show that under the BS, CET, and CT scenarios, the SCC of China's eight regions increases by $22.26/t C, $20.58/t C, and $19.14/t C, respectively, from 2005 to 2050. The CT scenario performed best in terms of impact on CEs and SCC, but in order to do so they will have to bear certain economic losses. There are differences between the SCC of the eight Chinese regions under different scenarios. Under the BS, CET, and CT scenarios, the areas where SCC is highest are distributed in the Central, North Coast, and Southwest regions, and in the CQ scenario, the high-SCC areas are concentrated in the Southwest, North Coast, and Northeast regions. The low-SCC areas are distributed in the Beijing-Tianjin and South Coast regions under all four scenarios. The central and western regions will become the major energy consuming regions after 2025, so they will face a greater pressure than other regions to reduce emissions.","[Jin, Gui] China Univ Geosci, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xin; Zhang, Lei] Hubei Univ, Fac Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China; [Hu, Shougeng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Publ Adm, 388 Lumo Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China","Hu, SG (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Publ Adm, 388 Lumo Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",husg2009@gmail.com,"Jin, Gui/M-5431-2018","Jin, Gui/0000-0002-2496-458X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [2016YFA0602500]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [71974070, 41771568, 71533004, 41501593]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (2016YFA0602500).

Achieving the climate targets of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals requires better accounting for climate and health costs in energy planning. This paper quantifies trade-offs between selected energy infrastructure, climate, and health costs when meeting future electricity demand by increasing the share of renewable energy, with a focus on variable renewable energy (VRE; here: wind and solar photovoltaic power). Using a spatially and temporally resolved approach, we analyzed three scenarios for year 2030 for Northeast Brazil, characterized by 30%, 45%, and 70% of VRE (the latter corresponds to 100% renewable energy). We find that accounting for the health impacts from electricity generation is sufficient to economically justify deep decarbonization of Northeast Brazil's power sector. Full decarbonization is economically justified when the carbon price exceeds $20/tonne CO2, which is less than Brazil's country-level social cost of carbon and only 4.8% of the global social cost of carbon. Our study shows that regional climate and health costs from electricity generation alone can be greater than the additional infrastructure costs of decarbonization. Our results highlight how systematically accounting for health and climate costs in energy planning would economically justify the decarbonization of energy systems.","[Howard, D.

This paper provides a first estimate of the potential for mitigation in the whole Spanish agriculture. A set of mitigation measures are selected for their cost-effectiveness and abatement potential and an efficient mix of these measures is identified with reference to a social cost of carbon of 40 sic/tCO(2)e. This mix of measures includes adjusting crop fertilization and managing forests for carbon sequestration. Results indicate that by using the efficient mix of mitigation measures the annual abatement potential could reach 10 million tCO(2)e, which represents 28% of current agricultural emissions in Spain. This potential could further increase if the social cost of carbon rises covering the costs of applying manure to crops. Results indicate also that economic instruments such as input and emission taxes could be only ancillary measures to address mitigation in agriculture. These findings can be used to support the mitigation efforts in Spain and guide policymakers in the design of country-level mitigation strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, these habitats are under threat by increased levels of economic activities and extreme weather events. Consequently, as those ecosystems become scarce their value is expected to increase. In this paper the value of information, the increase in knowledge that renders a system or a function more valuable, from marine habitat mapping is presented through the (monetary) valuation of one regulating service provided by the newly mapped habitats. Mapping a section of a channel with a multibeam echosounder revealed more seagrass resources than in previous studies. Using values for both the Social Cost of Carbon and Abatement Cost methods, from the literature we estimate the value of the carbon sequestration and storage service these seagrass meadows provide. The impacts of hurricanes in the newly mapped seagrasses were also investigated. Despite the costs of mapping, monitoring and of projected losses of ecosystem services provision due to hurricanes, net benefits over a time period of 50 years were considerably larger. The new information provided highlights carbon capturing habitats as more important, enabling the value of information to inform policymaking. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Determining an adequate CO2 tax level is complicated for political reasons, but even more so for scientific, economic, and ethical reasons. Through a literature review and subsequent analyses, this study explores the influence of methodological choices on greenhouse gas (GHG) environmental costs, focussing on the European context. Two main approaches exist, relying either on marginal damage costs (MDCs; 17 studies considered) or on marginal abatement costs (MACs; five studies considered). Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) quantify the utility losses for individuals, expressed as MDCs. Only seven of the 17 studies examined policy-relevant GHG MDCs applicable to the European context. Current MDCs are either limited in terms of impacts considered (and those that are included are based on dated cause-effect relationships) or rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)-based impact functions that disregard, or arbitrarily include, disutility from impacts on non-marketed goods and services, including due to catastrophic events. Therefore, this paper identifies development needs of the IAMs. MACs, in turn, correspond to politically consistent costs to achieve politically set goals, if existing, with no immediate link to the impacts avoided. Depending on the methodological choices made, MDCs and MACs may well span two orders of magnitude. Consensus exists that discounting be conducted at low (social) rates. Primarily moral arguments support the use of equity weighting. Because there are impacts specific to CO2 and CH4 and unrelated to radiative forcing, and because measures differ between GHGs, using global warming potentials (GWPs) for deriving non-CO2 environmental costs from those for CO2 is only a fall-back solution. For a better policy support, MDCs that comprehensively cover climate change impacts and show a high degree of detail should be provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The DCFA allows the analysis of investment costs, operating costs and savings of the two different systems in order to understand if the GCHP's payback periods (PBPs) are more interesting than that of CB in coming years. The first financial model (DCFA) takes account for economic factors as prices, costs and growth, while the economic approach (CBA) includes the carbon price into the calculation, considering the social costs of carbon dioxide emissions. The whole analysis is implemented to adopting a parametric approach, in which all the economic terms are linked to energy labels, degree-days and energy mix ratios (EMRs), the latter obtained as the ratio between the cost of electricity and natural gas paid by the householder. Relating to different EMRs, the PBPs are presented in matrices in which energy labels and degree-days are the row/column indexes, to confront the benefits of choosing between GCHP and CB. The PBPs are also calculated with the introduction of the carbon price so that some considerations about the environmental aspects are presented. The results show that all higher energy labels have a good profitability ratio between costs and payback periods and demonstrate that GCHP system does pay off. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It includes PV's potential direct marginal energy value including avoided losses, and marginal environmental value with respect to regional air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. This methodology is then applied for the example of 61 domestic rooftop PV systems located in Sydney. Results highlight that residential PV systems would seem to offer net societal benefits under reasonable assumptions of their energy and environmental values including the social cost of carbon, and given social discount rates. Much depends, however, on the assumed level of the social cost of carbon (SCC) and the system performance including issues of orientation, maintenance and shading. While such evaluations of societal value are challenging, they have an important policy role in better aligning private incentives for and against residential PV deployment with the societal benefits that such deployment can bring.

The predictions of the simple framework are tested in a calibrated numerical and more complex version of the integrated assessment model (IAM). This IAM makes use of the Oxford carbon cycle of Allen et al. (2009), Which differs from DICE, FUND and PAGE in that cumulative emissions are the key driving force of changes in temperature. We highlight the importance of the speed and direction of technological change for the energy transition and how time impatience, intergenerational inequality aversion and expected trend growth affect the time paths of the optimal global carbon tax and the optimal amount of fossil fuel reserves to leave untapped.

Further, we examine how this second-best pricing fits with government set goals of reducing CO2 emissions. The paper further develops an analytical framework for assessing first- and second-best road prices on vehicle kilometers, extending it to include EVs and externalities that vary geographically and by time of day. We find that optimal road prices largely vary with external cost, but are also significantly affected by the interactions with the rest of the fiscal system. Not surprisingly, the highest road prices should be for ICEVs in large cities during peak hours due to high external costs. More surprisingly, we find that the road price for ICEVs in rural areas should be lower than that for EVs due to large fiscal interaction effects. These road prices give large welfare gains, but they lead to no reduction in carbon emissions when applying the currently recommended social cost of carbon.","[Wangsness, Paal Brevik] Norwegian Ctr Transport Res, Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadaleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway","Wangsness, PB (corresponding author), Norwegian Ctr Transport Res, Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadaleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",pbw@toi.no,,"Wangsness, Paal/0000-0001-6952-8805",Norwegian Research Council (NRC)Research Council of Norway [255077]; Energy Norway; Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate; Ringeriks-Kraft AS; Norwegian Public Roads Administration; Statkraft Energi AS,"This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council (NRC) through NRC project 255077.

The current status of agricultural residue as a source of bioenergy globally and in Iran was investigated. The total number of publications in this field from 2000 to 2014 was about 4294. Iran ranked 21st with approximately 54 published studies. A total of 87 projects have been devised globally to produce second-generation biofuel through biochemical pathways. There are currently no second-generation biorefineries in Iran and agricultural residue has no significant application. The present study determined the amount and types of sustainable agricultural residue and oil-rich crops and their provincial distribution. Wheat, barley, rice, corn, potatoes, alfalfa, sugarcane, sugar beets, apples, grapes, dates, cotton, soybeans, rapeseed, sesame seeds, olives, sunflowers, safflowers, almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts have the greatest potential as agronomic and horticultural crops to produce bioenergy in Iran. A total of 11.33 million tonnes (Mt) of agricultural biomass could be collected for production of bioethanol (3.84 gigaliters (Gl)), biobutanol (1.07 Gl), biogas (3.15 billion cubic meters (BCM)), and biohydrogen (0.90 BCM). Additionally, about 0.35 Gl of biodiesel could be obtained using only 35% of total Iranian oilseed. The potential production capacity of conventional biofuel blends in Iran, environmental and socio-economic impacts including well-to-wheel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the social cost of carbon dioxide reduction are discussed. The cost of emissions could decrease up to 55.83% by utilizing E85 instead of gasoline. The possible application of gaseous biofuel in Iran to produce valuable chemicals and provide required energy for crop cultivation is also studied. The energy recovered from biogas produced by wheat residue could provide energy input for 115.62 and 393.12 thousand hectares of irrigated and rain-fed wheat cultivation in Iran, respectively. The nitrogen requirement for 33.6% of the total wheat cultivation area could be supplied by the ammonia acquired from biohydrogen. A discussion of the logistics of collection and transportation of the biomass and sensitivity analysis are carried out to evaluate the effect of field cover factor, crop yield, and well-to-wheel GHG emission on collectable residue, biofuel production, and GHG emissions.

Despite this focus, more than one billion people worldwide lack access to electricity, and electrification rates need to more than quadruple to meet international goals. We believe that lack of progress is partly driven by a know-do gap, a misalignment between academic research and the information needs of policy makers. Most studies measuring the impacts of electrification focus on precise estimation of a few outcomes, specifically health, education and productivity impacts. Other important impacts, e.g. environmental, have remained largely unstudied. As a consequence, quantifying the full set of costs and benefits of expanding electricity access is difficult and rarely done. When cost benefit analyses are done, they are often incomplete, and conclusions are highly susceptible to unavailable or uncertain parameters. We illustrate these arguments in the case of Bhutan, where RE rates have expanded rapidly in the past few decades. We show that RE via grid extension had positive impacts related to fuelwood consumption, education, and employment, but we do not find an effect on health. We then use these impact estimates to conduct cost-benefit analyses. For the cost-benefit parameters not available from our impact evaluation, we transfer reasonable estimates from related contexts. To acknowledge the uncertainty induced by this process, we conduct Monte Carlo analyses and confirm that, while the private NPV calculations are robust to alternative parameter values, the social returns are sensitive to estimates of the social cost of carbon and costs of grid operation and maintenance. Based on this exercise, we highlight research gaps that persist and that preclude 1) careful cost-benefit analysis of RE more generally and 2) financial investment in the sector.

However, the effect is stronger than suggested in the literature. Moreover, the development of non-fossil energy technologies constitutes the most important opportunity for emission reductions.

However, real-world waste management can differ from idealized practices, and emissions driven by microbial communities and complex chemical processes are poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive life-cycle assessment, using reported and measured data, of competing management alternatives for organic municipal solid waste including landfilling, composting, dry anaerobic digestion (AD) for the production of renewable natural gas (RNG), and dry AD with electricity generation. Landfilling is the most greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensive option, emitting nearly 400 kg CO2e per tonne of organic waste. Composting raw organics resulted in the lowest GHG emissions, at -41 kg CO2e per tonne of waste, while upgrading biogas to RNG after dry AD resulted in -36 to -2 kg CO2e per tonne. Monetizing the results based on social costs of carbon and other air pollutant emissions highlights the importance of ground-level NH3 emissions from composting nitrogen-rich organic waste or post-AD solids. However, better characterization of material-specific NH3 emissions from landfills and land-application of digestate is essential to fully understand the trade-oils between alternatives.","[Nordahl, Sarah L.; Devkota, Jay P.; Amirebrahimi, Jahon; Smith, Sarah Josephine; Breunig, Hanna M.; Preble, Chelsea, V; Satchwell, Andrew J.; Jin, Ling; Brown, Nancy J.; Kirchstetter, Thomas W.; Scown, Corinne D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Scown, Corinne D.] Joint BioEnergy Inst, Emeryville, CA 94720 USA; [Nordahl, Sarah L.; Smith, Sarah Josephine; Preble, Chelsea, V; Kirchstetter, Thomas W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Amirebrahimi, Jahon] Univ Calif Davis, Agr & Resource Econ Dept, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Scown, CD (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Technol Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Scown, CD (corresponding author), Joint BioEnergy Inst, Emeryville, CA 94720 USA.",cdscown@lbl.gov,,"Satchwell, Andrew/0000-0002-4405-3599","California Energy Commission [EPC-14-044, EPC-14-030]; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental ResearchUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Bioenergy Technologies OfficeUnited States Department of Energy (DOE)","The research for this paper was financially supported by the California Energy Commission under agreement number EPC-14-044 and EPC-14-030.

To capture 2.0 Gt CO2/year, for example, it could emit 32 Gg NH3/year in the United States given current design targets or 15 times higher (480 Gg NH3/year) at rates typical of current pilot plants. Employing a chemical transport model, we found that the latter emission rate would cause an increase of 2.0 mu g PM2.5/m(3) in nonattainment areas during wintertime, which would be troublesome for PM2.5-burdened areas, and much lower increases during other seasons. Wintertime PM2.5 increases in nonattainment areas were fairly linear at a rate of 3.4 mu g PM2.5/m(3) per 1 Tg NH3, allowing these results to be applied to other CCS emissions scenarios. The PM2.5 impacts are modestly uncertain (+/- 20%) depending on future emissions of SO2, NOx, and NH3. The public health costs of CCS NH3 emissions were valued at $31+68 per tonne CO2 captured, comparable to the social cost of carbon itself. Because the costs of solvent loss to CCS operators are lower than the social costs of CCS ammonia, there is a regulatory interest to limit ammonia emissions from CCS.","[Heo, Jinhyok; McCoy, Sean T.; Adams, Peter J.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Adams, Peter J.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Heo, J (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",heoj@alumni.cmu.edu,"Heo, Jinhyok/B-8915-2016; Adams, Peter J/D-7134-2013","Heo, Jinhyok/0000-0003-0348-4111; Adams, Peter J/0000-0003-0041-058X; McCoy, Sean/0000-0003-0401-893X",center for Climate and Energy Decision Making [SES-0949710],This work was supported by the center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (SES-0949710) through a cooperative agreement between the National Science Foundation and Carnegie Mellon University.,,77,7,7,3,42,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

To improve the fuel performance of engines, combustor temperatures and pressures often increase, increasing NOx, emissions. Conversely, combustor modifications to reduce NOx, may increase CO2. Hence, a technology trade-off exists, which also translates to a trade-off between short-lived climate forcers and a long-lived greenhouse gas, CO2. Moreover, the NOx-O-3-CH4 system responds in a nonlinear manner, according to both aviation emissions and background NOx,. A simple climate model was modified to incorporate nonlinearities parametrized from a complex chemistry model. Case studies showed that for a scenario of a 20% reduction in NOx, emissions the consequential CO2 penalty of 2% actually increased the total radiative forcing (RF). For a 2% fuel penalty, NO, emissions needed to be reduced by >43% to realize an overall benefit. Conversely, to ensure that the fuel penalty for a 20% NO, emission reduction did not increase overall forcing, a 0.5% increase in CO2 was found to be the break even point.

We examine the potential roles for residential energy storage (RES), a technology thought to be at the epicenter of these twin revolutions. We model the impact of grid-connected RES operation on electricity costs and GHG emissions for households in 16 of the largest U.S. utility service territories under 3 plausible operational modes. Regardless of operation mode, RES mostly increases emissions when users seek to minimize their electricity cost. When operated with the goal of minimizing emissions, RES can reduce average household emissions by 2.2-6.4%, implying a cost equivalent of $180 to $5160 per metric ton of carbon dioxide avoided. While RES is costly compared with many other emission-control measures, tariffs that internalize the social cost of carbon would reduce emissions by 0.1-5.9% relative to cost minimizing operation. Policy-makers should be careful about assuming that decentralization will clean the electric power system, especially if it proceeds without carbon-mindful tariff reforms.","[Babacan, Oytun; Abdulla, Ahmed; Hanna, Ryan; Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Babacan, Oytun; Abdulla, Ahmed; Hanna, Ryan; Victor, David G.] Univ Calif San Diego, Deep Decarbonizat Initiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Abdulla, Ahmed; Kleissl, Jan] Univ Calif San Diego, Energy Res Ctr, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Kleissl, Jan] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Victor, David G.] Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA","Babacan, O (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Babacan, O (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Deep Decarbonizat Initiat, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",oybabacan@ucsd.edu,,"Babacan, Oytun/0000-0001-9141-8872",,,,46,3,3,3,9,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

However, it has been argued that the additional economic cost of batteries, emissions occurring during the manufacturing phase of batteries, and emissions caused by losses during the use phase can reduce batteries' potential in supporting the decarbonization of the electricity sector. Here, we perform a new battery production- and use-phase lifecycle emissions and cost analysis to calculate the additional lifecycle greenhoues gas (GHG) emissions (LCE) and costs (LCC) that arise from storing electricity in six different battery technologies, five applications, and three different geographies. Our results show that the LCE of storing electricity are strongly determined by application and geography, whereas LCC vary with application and technology. Lithium-ion technologies perform best across most applications and geographies on both the LCE and LCC dimensions. Furthermore, we only identify trade-offs between the LCC and the GHG emissions cost when assuming a high social cost of GHG emissions of 180 EUR/tonCO(2)e.

Standard life cycle assessment methodology ignores the impact of green-house gases relative to when they are emitted. In this paper, we present a method for leveraging the social cost of greenhouse gases to account for the temporal impacts of emissions in life cycle assessment and techno-economics. To demonstrate, we use this method to analyze the present value of the monetized impacts of emissions across multiple electricity generation technologies. Results show that accounting for time increases the present value across all but one of the technologies considered. Carbon intensive technologies show the highest increase, with coal rising between 26% and 62% depending on social cost scenario. Additionally, we demonstrate a second method that combines temporally resolved greenhouse gas emissions with techno-economic analysis. Considering temporal impacts of emissions within techno-economic analysis increases the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) across all technologies considered. Carbon intensive technologies increase significantly, with the LCOE from coal rising between 37% and 263% depending on the social cost scenario. The proposed methods show that temporal resolution in life cycle assessment is critical for comparing the monetized impacts of greenhouse gas emissions across technologies.","[Sproul, Evan; Barlow, Jay; Quinn, Jason C.] Colorado State Univ, Mech Engn, 1374 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA","Quinn, JC (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Mech Engn, 1374 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA.",Jason.Quinn@colostate.edu,,,Quinn Research Group,The authors are grateful for support and text editing from the Quinn Research Group and Danna Quinn.,,42,1,1,2,11,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

TGRP is a modification of fast pyrolysis that recycles its noncondensable gases and produces a bio-oil low in oxygen concentration and rich in naphthalene. Herein, we evaluate the coproduction of phenol as a value-added renewable chemical, alongside jet-range fuels within distributed TGRP systems using techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment. We investigate the metrics global warming potential (GWP), cumulative exergy demand (CExD), and cost for the conversion of 200 dry metric tons per day of horse manure to bio-oil and its subsequent upgrade to hydrocarbon fuel and phenolic chemicals. Assigning credits for the offset of the coproducts, the net GWP and CExD of TGRP jet fuel are 10 g of CO2 eq and 0.4 MJ per passenger kilometer distance traveled, respectively. These values are considerably lower than the GWP and CExD of petroleum-based aviation fuel. The minimum fuel selling price of the TGRP jet fuel ($1.35-$1.80 L-1) is estimated to be much greater than that of petroleum-based aviation fuel ($0.42 L-1), except under optimized fuel conversion and coproduct market conditions ($0.53-$0.79 L-1) when including a market price for carbon.","[Sorunmu, Yetunde E.; Billen, Pieter; Spatari, Sabrina] Drexel Univ, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 3141 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Elkasabi, Yaseen; Mullen, Charles A.; Boateng, Akwasi A.] ARS, Eastern Reg Res Ctr, USDA, 600 E Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, PA 19038 USA; [Macken, Nelson A.] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Engn, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Billen, Pieter] Univ Antwerp, Biochem Green Engn & Mat, Salesianenlaan 90, B-2660 Hoboken, Belgium","Spatari, S (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 3141 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ss3226@drexel.edu,"Billen, Pieter/M-1838-2018","Billen, Pieter/0000-0003-3546-0157; Sorunmu, Yetunde/0000-0003-2074-6371; Mullen, Charles/0000-0001-5739-5451; Boateng, Akwasi/0000-0002-8496-2201",U.S. Department of Agriculture under USDA-NIFA [2012-10008-20271],"Funding for this work was provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture under USDA-NIFA No. 2012-10008-20271.

We use engine simulations, a review of experimental data, and drive cycle simulations to estimate the reduction in fuel consumption associated with using higher-RON gasoline in individual vehicles. Lifecycle CO2 emissions and economic impacts for the U.S. LDV fleet are estimated based on a linear-programming refinery model, a historically calibrated fleet model, and a well-to-wheels emissions analysis. We find that greater use of high-RON gasoline in appropriately tuned vehicles could reduce annual gasoline consumption in the U.S. by 3.0-4.4%. Accounting for the increase in refinery emissions from production of additional high-RON gasoline, net CO2 emissions are reduced by 19-35 Mt/y in 2040 (2.5-4.7% of total direct LDV CO2 emissions). For the strategies studied, the annual direct economic benefit is estimated to be $0.4-6.4 billion in 2040, and the annual net societal benefit including the social cost of carbon is estimated to be $1.7-8.8 billion in 2040.

This research assesses the net societal benefits and costs of Monoethanolamine (MEA) CCS, valuing changes in emissions of CO2, SO2, NOX, NH3 and particulate matter (PM), including those in the supply chain. Geographical variability and stochastic uncertainty for 407 coal power plant locations in the U.S. are analyzed. The results show that the net environmental benefits and costs of MEA CCS depend critically on location. For a few favorable sites of both power plant and upstream processes, CCS realizes a net benefit (benefitcost ratio >1) if the social cost of carbon exceeds $51/ton. For much of the U.S. however, the social cost of carbon must be much higher to realize net benefits from CCS, up to a maximum of $910/ton. While the social costs of carbon are uncertain, typical estimates are in the range of $32-220 per ton, much lower than the breakeven value for many potential CCS locations.

We find that exported U.S. LNG has mean precombustion emissions of 37 g CO2-equiv/MJ when regasified in Europe and Asia. Shipping emissions of LNG exported from U.S. ports to Asian and European markets account for only 3.5-5.5% of precombustion life cycle emissions, hence shipping distance is not a major driver of GHGs. A scenario-based analysis addressing how potential end uses (electricity and industrial heating) and displacement of existing fuels (coal and Russian natural gas) affect GHG emissions shows the mean emissions for electricity generation using U.S. exported LNG were 655 g CO2-equiv/kWh (with a 90% confidence interval of 562770), an 11% increase over U.S. natural gas electricity generation. Mean emissions from industrial heating were 104 g CO2-equiv/MJ (90% CI: 87123). By displacing coal, LNG saves 550 g CO2-equiv per kWh of electricity and 20 g per MJ of heat. LNG saves GHGs under upstream fugitive emissions rates up to 9% and 5% for electricity and heating, respectively. GHG reductions were found if Russian pipeline natural gas was displaced for electricity and heating use regardless of GWP, as long as U.S. fugitive emission rates remain below the estimated 57% rate of Russian gas. However, from a country specific carbon accounting perspective, there is an imbalance in accrued social costs and benefits. Assuming a mean social cost of carbon of $49/metric ton, mean global savings from U.S. LNG displacement of coal for electricity generation are $1.50 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gaseous natural gas exported as LNG ($.028/kWh). Conversely, the U.S. carbon cost of exporting the LNG is $1.80/Mcf ($.013/kWh), or $0.50-$5.50/Mcf across the range of potential discount rates. This spatial shift in embodied carbon emissions is important to consider in national interest estimates for LNG exports.","[Abrahams, Leslie S.; Griffin, W. Michael; Matthews, H.

I use a two-period model with a stock pollutant where the number of countries generating pollution can be arbitrarily large. The stability concept employed is such that size of the stable IEA can be anywhere between 2 and the grand coalition of all countries depending on parameter values. The dynamic structure allows two different membership rules for an IEA: fixed ( countries commit at the outset to be members for both periods) or variable ( countries decide each period whether to join). I show that with fixed membership learning results in at least as high membership and global welfare as no learning ( unless both the expected value and variance of damage costs are high). With variable membership, learning leads to higher membership ( in the second period) but lower global welfare than no learning. For most parameter values variable membership results in higher global welfare than fixed membership.","Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England","Ulph, A (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",amu@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,27,49,49,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Major emitters seem unwilling to accept binding emissions reductions targets as their economies have stagnated. The talks at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference in Copenhagen in 2009 were meant to represent a watershed moment for global cooperation on climate change(1) but produced little more than a symbolic accord(2). Fast forward another three years and the outcomes of the Doha negotiations(3-5) deferred the key decisions on climate change mitigation to 2015, as the Durban Platform did before(6). Is this neglect justified? Here we use the PAGE09 integrated assessment model(7) to estimate the mean social cost of CO2 for a wide range of economic growth scenarios. The social cost of CO2 measures the net present value of the extra damage caused by the emission of one more tonne of CO2 today. The results show that in a world with sustained lower economic growth the mean social cost of CO2 increases because the climate impacts occur in a relatively poor world, suggesting that, if anything, mitigating climate change should be a higher priority for policymakers in a low-growth world.","[Hope, Chris] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB5 8HL, England; [Hope, Mat] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England","Hope, C (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB5 8HL, England.",c.hope@jbs.cam.ac.uk,,,European CommunityEuropean Community (EC) [212774]; UK Department of Energy and Climate Change,"Development of the PAGE09 model received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme, as part of the Climate Cost Project (Full Costs of Climate Change, Grant Agreement 212774) www.climatecost.eu and from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change.",,23,4,4,0,21,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

Our model of climate and the economy is a stochastic version of a model employed in assessing the US Social Cost of Carbon (DICE). We compute the optimal carbon taxes and CO2 abatement levels that maximize welfare from economic consumption over time under different risk states. In accordance with recent developments in finance, we separate preferences about time and risk to improve the model's calibration of welfare to observed market interest. We show that introducing the modern asset pricing framework doubles optimal abatement and carbon taxation. Uncertainty over the level of damages at a given temperature increase can result in a slight increase of optimal emissions as compared to using expected damages.

However, these models have been criticized for lacking a strong empirical basis for their damage functions, which do little to alter assumptions of sustained gross domestic product (GDP) growth, even under extreme temperature scenarios(1-3). We implement empirical estimates of temperature effects on GDP growth rates in the DICE model through two pathways, total factor productivity growth and capital depreciation(4,5). This damage specification, even under optimistic adaptation assumptions, substantially slows GDP growth in poor regions but has more modest effects in rich countries. Optimal climate policy in this model stabilizes global temperature change below 2 degrees C by eliminating emissions in the near future and implies a social cost of carbon several times larger than previous estimates(6). A sensitivity analysis shows that the magnitude of climate change impacts on economic growth, the rate of adaptation, and the dynamic interaction between damages and GDP are three critical uncertainties requiring further research. In particular, optimal mitigation rates are much lower if countries become less sensitive to climate change impacts as they develop, making this a major source of uncertainty and an important subject for future research.","[Moore, Frances C.] Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Moore, Frances C.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Diaz, Delavane B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Moore, FC (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Emmett Interdisciplinary Program Environm & Resou, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",fcmoore@stanford.edu,,"Diaz, Delavane/0000-0001-8289-0980",Neukermans Family Foundation Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship,"We would like to thank J.

The likelihood of such large-scale singular events(2) is expected to increase with global warming(1-3), but is fundamentally uncertain(4). A key question is how should the uncertainty surrounding tipping events(1,5) affect climate policy? We address this using a stochastic integrated assessment model(6), based on the widely used deterministic DICE model(7). The temperature-dependent likelihood of tipping is calibrated using expert opinions(3), which we find to be internally consistent. The irreversible impacts of tipping events are assumed to accumulate steadily over time (rather than instantaneously(8-11)), consistent with scientific understanding(1,5). Even with conservative assumptions about the rate and impacts of a stochastic tipping event, today's optimal carbon tax is increased by similar to 50%. For a plausibly rapid, high-impact tipping event, today's optimal carbon tax is increased by >200%. The additional carbon tax to delay climate tipping grows at only about half the rate of the baseline carbon tax. This implies that the effective discount rate for the costs of stochastic climate tipping is much lower than the discount rate(7,12,13) for deterministic climate damages. Our results support recent suggestions that the costs of carbon emission used to inform policy(12,13) are being underestimated(14-16), and that uncertain future climate damages should be discounted at a low rate(17-20).","[Lontzek, Thomas S.] Univ Zurich, Dept Quantitat Business Adm, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Cai, Yongyang; Judd, Kenneth L.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cai, Yongyang] Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst, Chicago, IL 60636 USA; [Judd, Kenneth L.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lenton, Timothy M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Earth Syst Sci Grp, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England","Lontzek, TS (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Quantitat Business Adm, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",lontzek@gmail.com; t.m.lenton@exeter.ac.uk,"Lenton, Tim M/X-1893-2018","Lenton, Tim M/0000-0002-6725-7498","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0951576, OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; Zuricher Universitatsverein; University of Zurich; Ecosciencia Foundation; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit AwardRoyal Society of London; European Commission HELIX Project [ENV.2013.6.1-3]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F005474/2] Funding Source: Researchfish","We thank K.

Multiple tipping points affect each other's probability of occurrence, potentially causing a 'domino effect'. We analyse climate policy in the presence of a potential domino effect. We incorporate three different tipping points occurring at unknown thresholds into an integrated climate-economy model. The optimal emission policy considers all possible thresholds and the resulting interactions between tipping points, economic activity, and policy responses into the indefinite future. We quantify the cost of delaying optimal emission controls in the presence of uncertain tipping points and also the benefit of detecting when individual tipping points have been triggered. We show that the presence of these tipping points nearly doubles today's optimal carbon tax and reduces peak warming along the optimal path by approximately 1 degrees C. The presence of these tipping points increases the cost of delaying optimal policy until mid-century by nearly 150%.","[Lemoine, Derek] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, McClelland Hall 401, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Traeger, Christian P.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Traeger, Christian P.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Postbox 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway","Traeger, CP (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Traeger, CP (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Postbox 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",traeger@berkeley.edu,,"Lemoine, Derek/0000-0002-1298-9472",National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management [GEO-1240507],C.P.T. gratefully acknowledges support by the National Science Foundation through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management GEO-1240507.,,44,36,36,4,29,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

To address their policy implications, we incorporated five interacting climate tipping points into a stochastic-dynamic integrated assessment model, calibrating their likelihoods and interactions on results from an existing expert elicitation. Here we show that combining realistic assumptions about policymakers' preferences under uncertainty, with the prospect of multiple future interacting climate tipping points, increases the present social cost of carbon in the model nearly eightfold from US$15 per tCO(2) to US$116 per tCO(2). Furthermore, passing some tipping points increases the likelihood of other tipping points occurring to such an extent that it abruptly increases the social cost of carbon. The corresponding optimal policy involves an immediate, massive effort to control CO2 emissions, which are stopped by mid-century, leading to climate stabilization at <1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.","[Cai, Yongyang] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Cai, Yongyang] Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst, Chicago, IL 60636 USA; [Lenton, Timothy M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Earth Syst Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England; [Lontzek, Thomas S.] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland","Lenton, TM (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Earth Syst Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England.; Lontzek, TS (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",t.m.lenton@exeter.ac.uk; lontzek@gmail.com,"Lenton, Tim M/X-1893-2018","Lenton, Tim M/0000-0002-6725-7498","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0951576, SES-146364, OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; Zuricher Universitatsverein; University of Zurich; Ecosciencia Foundation; Royal SocietyRoyal Society of London; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ENV.2013.6.1-3]","We thank K.

In an idealized economically optimal scenario(4,5), warming continues until the social cost of carbon, which increases with both temperature and consumption because of greater willingness to pay for climate change avoidance in a prosperous world, exceeds the marginal cost of abatement at zero emissions, which is the cost of preventing, or recapturing, the last net tonne of CO2 emissions. Here I show that, under these conditions, peak warming is primarily determined by two quantities that are directly affected by near-term policy: the cost of 'backstop' mitigation measures available as temperatures approach their peak (those whose cost per tonne abated does not increase as emissions fall to zero); and the average carbon intensity of growth (the ratio between average emissions and the average rate of economic growth) between now and the time of peak warming. Backstop costs are particularly important at low peak warming levels. This highlights the importance of maintaining economic growth in a carbon-constrained world and reducing the cost of backstop measures, such as large-scale CO2 removal, in any ambitious consumption-maximizing strategy to limit peak warming.","[Allen, Myles R.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Allen, Myles R.] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England","Allen, MR (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.; Allen, MR (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England.",myles.allen@ouce.ox.ac.uk,,,Oxford Martin Programme on Resource Stewardship; Kung Carl XVI Gustaf 50-arsfond; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/H003495/1] Funding Source: Researchfish,"The author would like to thank students on the University of Oxford 'Physics of Climate Change' and 'Environmental Change and Management' courses for their patience with early versions of the analysis; R.

The pledges fall in the lower end of the distributions of the social cost of carbon and the cost-minimizing path to limiting warming to 2 degrees C, suggesting insufficient global ambition in light of leaders' climate goals. Countries' marginal abatement costs vary by two orders of magnitude, illustrating that large efficiency gains are available through joint mitigation efforts and/or carbon price coordination.

The SCC expresses in monetary terms the social impact of the emission of a ton of CO2 in a given year. The SCC is calculated using a 'social welfare function' (SWF): a method for assessing social welfare. The dominant SWF in climate policy is the discounted-utilitarian SWF. Individuals' well-being numbers (utilities) are summed, and the values for later generations are reduced ('discounted'). This SWF has been criticized for ignoring the distribution of well-being and including an arbitrary time preference. Here, we use a 'prioritarian' SWF, with no time discount, to calculate the SCC. This SWF gives extra weight ('priority') to worse-off individuals. Prioritarianism is a well-developed concept in ethics and welfare economics, but has been rarely used in climate scholarship.

Certified green buildings substantially reduce energy consumption on a per square foot basis and they also focus on indoor environmental quality. However, the co-benefits to health through reductions in energy and concomitant reductions in air pollution have not been examined. We calculated year by year LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification rates in six countries (the United States, China, India, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey) and then used data from the Green Building Information Gateway (GBIG) to estimate energy savings in each country each year. Of the green building rating schemes, LEED accounts for 32% of green-certified floor space and publically reports energy efficiency data. We employed Harvard's Co-BE Calculator to determine pollutant emissions reductions by country accounting for transient energy mixes and baseline energy use intensities. Co-BE applies the social cost of carbon and the social cost of atmospheric release to translate these reductions into health benefits. Based on modeled energy use, LEED-certified buildings saved $7.5B in energy costs and averted 33MT of CO2, 51kt of SO2, 38kt of NOx, and 10 kt of PM2.5 from entering the atmosphere, which amounts to $5.8B (lower limit = $2.3B, upper limit = $9.1B) in climate and health co-benefits from 2000 to 2016 in the six countries investigated. The U.S. health benefits derive from avoiding an estimated 172-405 premature deaths, 171 hospital admissions, 11,000 asthma exacerbations, 54,000 respiratory symptoms, 21,000 lost days of work, and 16,000 lost days of school. Because the climate and health benefits are nearly equivalent to the energy savings for green buildings in the United States, and up to 10 times higher in developing countries, they provide an important and previously unquantified societal value. Future analyses should consider these co-benefits when weighing policy decisions around energy-efficient buildings.","[MacNaughton, P.; Cao, X.; Buonocore, J.; Cedeno-Laurent, J.; Bernstein, A.; Allen, J.] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Environm Hlth Dept, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Allen, J (corresponding author), Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Environm Hlth Dept, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jgallen@hsph.harvard.edu,,"Cao, Xiaodong/0000-0002-0890-3306",,,,59,24,24,8,58,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,NEW YORK,"75 VARICK ST, 9TH FLR, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1917 USA",1559-0631,1559-064X,,J EXPO SCI ENV EPID,J.

Here we present new damage functions based on the current scientific literature and introduce these into an integrated assessment model (IAM) in order to estimate a new SCC. We focus on the agricultural sector, use two methods for determining the yield impacts of warming, and the GTAP CGE model to calculate the economic consequences of yield shocks. These new damage functions reveal far more adverse agricultural impacts than currently represented in IAMs. Impacts in the agriculture increase from net benefits of $2.7 ton(-1) CO2 to net costs of $8.5 ton(-1), leading the total SCC to more than double.","[Moore, Frances C.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 2140 Wickson Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Baldos, Uris; Hertel, Thomas] Purdue Univ, Global Trade Anal Project, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Baldos, Uris; Hertel, Thomas] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hertel, Thomas] Purdue Climate Change Res Ctr, 203 S Martin Jischke Dr Gerald D & Edna E Mann Ha, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Diaz, Delavane] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Moore, FC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, 2140 Wickson Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",fmoore@ucdavis.edu,,"Diaz, Delavane/0000-0001-8289-0980",National Science Foundation under the RDCEP project at the University of Chicago [0951576]; USDA-NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [1003642]; USDA NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [12225279],"We thank Max Auffhammer, Sol Hsiang, Jerry Nelson, and David Lobell for comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

However, reducing air pollutant emissions may also have an important co-harm, as the aerosols they form produce net cooling overall. Nevertheless, aerosol impacts have not been fully incorporated into cost-benefit modeling that estimates how much the world should optimally mitigate. Here we find that when both co-benefits and co-harms are taken fully into account, optimal climate policy results in immediate net benefits globally, overturning previous findings from cost-benefit models that omit these effects. The global health benefits from climate policy could reach trillions of dollars annually, but will importantly depend on the air quality policies that nations adopt independently of climate change. Depending on how society values better health, economically optimal levels of mitigation may be consistent with a target of 2 degrees C or lower.","[Scovronick, Noah] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Scovronick, Noah; Fleurbaey, Marc; Wagner, Fabian] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Budolfson, Mark] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05310 USA; [Budolfson, Mark] Univ Vermont, Dept Philosophy, Burlington, VT 05310 USA; [Budolfson, Mark] Harvard Univ, Edmond J Safra Ctr Eth, 124 Mt Auburn St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dennig, Francis] Yale NUS Coll, Social Sci Econ, Singapore 138610, Singapore; [Dennig, Francis] Ctr Adv Study Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Errickson, Frank] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy & Resources Grp, 310 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Univ Ctr Human Values, 304 Louis Marx Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Peng, Wei] Penn State Univ, Sch Int Affairs, University Pk, PA 16801 USA; [Peng, Wei] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16801 USA; [Socolow, Robert H.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Olden St, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, 2225 Speedway, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Spears, Dean] Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, Delhi Ctr, 7 SJS Sansawal Marg, New Delhi 110016, India; [Spears, Dean] IZA Inst Lab Econ, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Spears, Dean] Inst Futures Studies, Hollandargatan 13, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wagner, Fabian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Wagner, Fabian] Princeton Univ, Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, 86 Olden St, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Scovronick, N (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, 1518 Clifton Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.; Scovronick, N (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",Scovronick@emory.edu,,"Scovronick, Noah/0000-0003-1410-3337; Wagner, Fabian/0000-0003-3429-2374",Climate Future's Initiative at Princeton University; Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont,We thank Ciara Burnham and the Climate Future's Initiative at Princeton University for support.

Although useful in an optimal policy context, a world-level approach obscures the heterogeneous geography of climate damage and vast differences in country-level contributions to the global SCC, as well as climate and socio-economic uncertainties, which are larger at the regional level. Here we estimate country-level contributions to the SCC using recent climate model projections, empirical climate-driven economic damage estimations and socio-economic projections. Central specifications show high global SCC values (median, US$417 per tonne of CO2 (tCO(2)); 66% confidence intervals, US$177-805 per tCO(2)) and a country-level SCC that is unequally distributed. However, the relative ranking of countries is robust to different specifications: countries that incur large fractions of the global cost consistently include India, China, Saudi Arabia and the United States.","[Ricke, Katharine] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ricke, Katharine] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Drouet, Laurent; Tavoni, Massimo] EIEE, RFF CMCC, Milan, Italy; [Caldeira, Ken] Carnegie Inst Sci, Stanford, CA USA; [Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy","Ricke, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Global Policy & Strategy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Ricke, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kricke@ucsd.edu,"Caldeira, Ken/E-7914-2011; Drouet, Laurent/J-9894-2019; Drouet, Laurent/A-2600-2019","Caldeira, Ken/0000-0002-4591-643X; Drouet, Laurent/0000-0002-4087-7662; Drouet, Laurent/0000-0002-4087-7662; tavoni, massimo/0000-0001-5069-4707",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC [336155]; EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [642147],M.T. thanks M.

This analysis shows that the 2 degrees C target is economically optimal in a version of the DICE model that includes updated climate science, climate damage estimates and evidence on social discount rates. Under the UN Paris Agreement, countries committed to limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees C and to actively pursue a 1.5 degrees C limit. Yet, according to the 2018 Economics Nobel laureate William Nordhaus, these targets are economically suboptimal or unattainable and the world community should aim for 3.5 degrees C in 2100 instead. Here, we show that the UN climate targets may be optimal even in the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, when appropriately updated. Changes to DICE include more accurate calibration of the carbon cycle and energy balance model, and updated climate damage estimates. To determine economically 'optimal' climate policy paths, we use the range of expert views on the ethics of intergenerational welfare. When updates from climate science and economics are considered jointly, we find that around three-quarters (or one-third) of expert views on intergenerational welfare translate into economically optimal climate policy paths that are consistent with the 2 degrees C (or 1.5 degrees C) target.","[Haensel, Martin C.] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil CEN, Hamburg, Germany; [Drupp, Moritz A.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Johansson, Daniel J.

However, the wide range of SCC estimates provides limited practical assistance to policymakers setting specific CO(2)prices. Here we describe an alternate near-term to net zero (NT2NZ) approach, estimating CO(2)prices needed in the near term for consistency with a net-zero CO(2)emissions target. This approach dovetails with the emissions-target-focused approach that frames climate policy discussions around the world, avoids uncertainties in estimates of climate damages and long-term decarbonization costs, offers transparency about sensitivities and enables the consideration of CO(2)prices alongside a portfolio of policies. We estimate illustrative NT2NZ CO(2)prices for the United States; for a 2050 net-zero CO(2)emission target, prices are US$34 to US$64 per metric ton in 2025 and US$77 to US$124 in 2030. These results are most influenced by assumptions about complementary policies and oil prices. Wide-ranging estimates of the social cost of carbon limit its usefulness in setting carbon prices. Near-term to net zero is an alternative modelling approach that focuses on the prices, combined with other policies, needed to set an economy on a pathway consistent with a net-zero emissions target.","[Kaufman, Noah; Marsters, Peter] Columbia Univ, SIPA Ctr Global Energy Policy, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Barron, Alexander R.] Smith Coll, Environm Sci & Policy, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Krawczyk, Wojciech; McJeon, Haewon] Univ Maryland, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Kaufman, N (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, SIPA Ctr Global Energy Policy, New York, NY 10027 USA.",nk2792@columbia.edu,,,Center on Global Energy Policy at the School of International and Public Affairs of Columbia University,"We thank K.

It is therefore encouraging to see the first signs of a 'natural capital approach' to decision making being accepted within government policy processes and the private sector. However, there are multiple different understandings of this 'approach', many of which misuse or omit key features of its foundations in natural science and economics. To address this, we present a framework for natural capital analysis and decision making that links ecological and economic perspectives. The natural capital concept is making way into government policy processes and the private sector, but different understandings of the approach might lead to misuse or omissions.

However, direct resource recovery and upcycling from wastes pose safety concerns related to source contamination. By carefully evaluating the potential integrations of existing and emerging bio-technologies, we put forward new possible pathways for the clean-tech upcycling of recovered carbon and nutrients. By coupling anaerobic digestion and thermochemical gasification, the key process line converts biowastes to clean gaseous substrates (e.g.H-2, CH4, CO2, CO, NH3, P-2), useable for the fermentative production of safe single cell protein (SCP). The subsequent direct (aerobic) or two-stage (anaerobic/aerobic) SCP fermentation of energy-rich gases can produce protein-rich microbial biomass. Worldwide, this is estimated to generate up to 606 Mt SCP per year, with the protein content more than 3 times the worldwide annual soybean meal protein production. The combined SCP and biochar production can further capture and store up to 2.33 Gt CO2-eq per year, representing similar to 50% of the Paris Agreement target on annual carbon capture. Finally, this approach could recycle up to 18.5 Mt nitrogen per year (similar to 8% of current N losses) and 6.5 Mt phosphorus per year (similar to 25% of the annual phosphorus fertilizer production). In view of a low-carbon and sustainable circular bioeconomy, this concept presents high impact and positive implications, especially in terms of safe future feed and food supply. Producing SCP as a multi-applicable recovery product can be already carried out at production costs that are competitive with those of other feed additives, especially if the social cost of carbon emissions is considered.","[Matassa, Silvio; Papirio, Stefano; Esposito, Giovanni; Pirozzi, Francesco] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Via Claudio 21, I-80125 Naples, Italy; [Pikaar, Ilje] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Pikaar, Ilje; Hulsen, Tim] Univ Queensland, Adv Water Management Ctr AWMC, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Leijenhorst, Evert] BTG Biomass Technol Grp BV, Josink Esweg 34, NL-7545 PN Enschede, Netherlands; [Verstraete, Willy] Univ Ghent, Ctr Microbial Ecol & Technol CMET, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Verstraete, Willy] Avecom NV, Ind Weg 122P, B-9032 Wondelgem, Belgium","Matassa, S (corresponding author), Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Via Claudio 21, I-80125 Naples, Italy.",silvio.matassa@unina.it,,"Matassa, Silvio/0000-0001-7232-6331",National Operational Programme (PON-Italy) 2014/2020,"Silvio Matassa is supported as a postdoctoral fellow by the Biofeedstock project, funded under the National Operational Programme (PON-Italy) 2014/2020.",,75,0,0,7,7,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,7-Aug,2020,22,15,,,,,4912,4929,,10.1039/d0gc01382j,,,18,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,MU0DS,WOS:000555342200007,,,,,9/30/2020

In a first step, we focus on the case of a single decision maker, and make use of an approach pioneered by Kimball (2014) for studying the impact of a marginal change in risk in optimal stochastic control models. Using a simple model with only one state variable and one control variable, we show how the optimal carbon tax responds to an increase in risk. It is found that the third derivative of the decay function of the stock of pollution may play a decisive role. In a second step, we investigate the extent to which Kimball's approach may be extended to the case of stochastic dynamic games. We show how strategic interactions complicate the task of evaluating the effects of an increase in risk. Interestingly, in a dynamic model of the tragedy of the commons, we find that an increase in risk can increase welfare even though all agents are risk averse. The reason is that higher risk can cause agents to be more conservative, and this mitigates the tragedy of the commons.","[Grafton, Quentin; Kompas, Tom] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Ngo Van Long] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada","Grafton, Q (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Kompas, Tom/M-8851-2019; Kompas, T/F-5930-2010; Grafton, Quentin/A-5277-2008","Kompas, Tom/0000-0002-0665-0966; Kompas, T/0000-0002-0665-0966; Grafton, Quentin/0000-0002-0048-9083",,,,32,0,0,0,12,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

Nationally, ethanol is blended with gasoline up to 10% (E10) for use in conventional vehicles, and up to 85% (E85) for use in flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs). Meeting the blending requirements could mean increasing the ethanol blended with gasoline or E85 use in FFVs. The authors estimate costs typically not quantified for FFV drivers refueling with E85, which are a small component of total costs, and consider the infrastructure costs to expand E85 access in Pennsylvania. Even with a retailer incentive of $0.01 to $0.39/gasoline liter equivalent (gle) to encourage ethanol infrastructure installation, an E85 consumer would still also experience higher refueling costs. A E85 consumer refueling and convenience cost of $0.95/gle is higher than historical ethanol subsidies. Additionally, although switching from E10 to E85 could reduce emissions, a refueling incentive of $1,320/metric ton CO2 is 36 times larger than the average U.S. social cost of carbon (CO2) for 2015.

To support climate preparedness and resilience planning for the electric sector, this study (1) proposes a framework for assessing the vulnerability of electricity systems in the remainder of this century using the Washington metro area as a case study, (2) evaluates the cost-effectiveness of deploying rooftop photovoltaic (PV) technology, and (3) employs quantitative probabilistic risk analysis in order to enhance adaptation planning and decision making. The results indicate that by the end of the century, the probability of power outages could increase 70-fold in the Washington metro area under the business-as-usual scenario. If the peak load on the electrical grid is cut by three quarters, the probability of outages could rise 20-fold. This reduction is achievable by installing solar panels on building roofs. There is about 136.45 m2 of suitable roof area for solar PV in the Washington metro area, which could add a generation capacity of 13.02 GW to the existing power system. The benefits of using rooftop PV to reduce the peak load on the power grid by 25%, 50%, and 75% are significantly greater than the costs when environmental impacts are considered. The cost-effectiveness of PV strategies may increase in the future because of declining material and installation prices and because of increased social cost of carbon emission.","[Zhang, Yating; Ayyub, Bilal M.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Technol & Syst Management, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Zhang, YT (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Technol & Syst Management, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",zhyating@umd.edu; ba@umd.edu,,,,,,56,0,0,6,6,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1076-0342,1943-555X,,J INFRASTRUCT SYST,J.

However, greenhouse-gas emissions from this sector have a significant impact on global climate, being responsible for over 3.5% of all anthropogenic radiative forcing. Also, the accrued visibility of aircraft emissions greatly affects the public image of the industry. In this context, incentive-based regulations, in the form of price or quantity controls, can be envisaged as alternatives to mitigate these emissions. The use of environmental charges in air transport, and the inclusion of the sector in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), are considered under a range of scenarios. The impacts of these measures on demand are estimated, and results suggest that they are likely to be minimal-mainly due to the high willingness to pay for air transport. In particular, in the EU ETS scenario currently favoured by the EU, demand reductions are less than 2%. This may not be true in the longer run, for short trips, or if future caps become more stringent. Furthermore, given current estimates of the social Cost Of CO2 as well as typical EU ETS prices, supply-side abatement would be too costly to be encouraged by these policies in the short term. The magnitude of aviation CO2 emissions in the EU is estimated, both in physical and monetary terms; the results are consistent with Eurocontrol estimates and, for the EU-25, the total social cost of these emissions represents only 0.03% of the region's GDP. It is concluded that the use of multisector policies, such as the EU ETS, is unsuitable for curbing emissions from air transport, and that stringent emission charges or an isolated ETS would be better instruments. However, the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS has advantages under target-oriented post-2012 scenarios, such as policy-costs dilution, certainty in reductions, and flexibility in abatement allocation. This solution is also attractive to airlines, as it would improve their public image but require virtually no reduction of their own emissions, as they would be fully capable of passing on policy costs to their customers.","[Santos, Georgina] Univ Oxford, Transport Studies Unit, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Mendes, Lucas M.

Seemingly small differences in the discount rate yield very different policy prescriptions, and no consensus correct value has been identified. We argue that the choice of discount rate is an ethical primitive: there are many different legitimate opinions as to its value, and none should receive a privileged place in economic analysis of climate policy. Rather, we advocate a social choice-based approach in which a diverse set of individual discount rates is aggregated into a representative rate. We show that performing this aggregation efficiently leads to a time-dependent discount rate that declines monotonically to the lowest rate in the population. We apply this discounting scheme to calculations of the social cost of carbon recently performed by the US government and show that it provides an attractive compromise between competing ethical positions, and thus provides a possible resolution to the ethical impasse in climate change economics.","[Heal, Geoffrey M.] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Millner, Antony] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England","Millner, A (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.millner@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC); Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment; Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: Researchfish,A.M. acknowledges support from the Economic and Social Research Council and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.,,21,30,30,0,19,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Selective extensification saves similar to 6 billion metric tons of carbon compared with a business-as-usual approach, with a value of approximately $1 trillion (2012 US dollars) using recent estimates of the social cost of carbon.

This is partly because the sum of estimated economic damage of climate change across various sectors, such as energy use and changes in agricultural production, results in only a small economic loss or even a small economic gain in the gross world product under predicted levels of climate change. However, those cost-benefit analyses rarely take account of environmental tipping points leading to abrupt and irreversible impacts on market and nonmarket goods and services, including those provided by the climate and by ecosystems. Here we show that including environmental tipping point impacts in a stochastic dynamic integrated assessment model profoundly alters cost-benefit assessment of global climate policy. The risk of a tipping point, even if it only has nonmarket impacts, could substantially increase the present optimal carbon tax. For example, a risk of only 5% loss in nonmarket goods that occurs with a 5% annual probability at 4 degrees C increase of the global surface temperature causes an immediate two-thirds increase in optimal carbon tax. If the tipping point also has a 5% impact on market goods, the optimal carbon tax increases by more than a factor of 3. Hence existing cost-benefit assessments of global climate policy may be significantly underestimating the needs for controlling climate change.","[Cai, Yongyang] Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cai, Yongyang; Judd, Kenneth L.] Hoover Inst War Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lenton, Timothy M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Earth Syst Sci, Exeter EX4 4QE, Devon, England; [Lontzek, Thomas S.] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; [Narita, Daiju] JICA, Res Inst, Tokyo 1628433, Japan; [Narita, Daiju] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Narita, D (corresponding author), JICA, Res Inst, Tokyo 1628433, Japan.",Narita.Daiju@jica.go.jp,"Narita, Daiju/AAH-2870-2020; Lenton, Tim M/X-1893-2018; Narita, Daiju/G-7125-2016","Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913; Lenton, Tim M/0000-0002-6725-7498; Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913","National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0951576]; German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit AwardRoyal Society of London; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [ENV.2013.6.1-3]; Zurcher Universitatsverein; University of Zurich; Ecosciencia Foundation; Blue Waters (NSF) [OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; state of Illinois; National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1S10OD018495-01]; Natural Environment Research CouncilNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/F005474/1] Funding Source: Researchfish","We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers whose comments helped improve and clarify the manuscript.

We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 20 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8% by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming today's technology and electricity market fundamentals. As the electricity grid is built to endure maximum load, our findings have significant implications for the construction of costly peak generating capacity, suggesting additional peak capacity costs of up to 180 billion dollars by the end of the century under business-as-usual.","[Auffhammer, Maximilian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Auffhammer, Maximilian; Hausman, Catherine H.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Baylis, Patrick] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA; [Baylis, Patrick] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1L4, Canada; [Hausman, Catherine H.] Univ Michigan, Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Auffhammer, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.; Auffhammer, M (corresponding author), Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",auffhammer@berkeley.edu,,,,,,26,69,70,4,24,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

We show that how future population is valued importantly determines mitigation decisions. Using the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, we explore two approaches to valuing population: a discounted version of total utilitarianism (TU), which considers total wellbeing and is standard in social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC) models, and of average utilitarianism (AU), which ignores population size and sums only each time period's discounted average wellbeing. Under both approaches, as population increases the SCC increases, but optimal peak temperature decreases. The effect is larger under TU, because it responds to the fact that a larger population means climate change hurts more people: for example, in 2025, assuming the United Nations (UN)-high rather than UN-low population scenario entails an increase in the SCC of 85% under TU vs. 5% under AU. The difference in the SCC between the two population scenarios under TU is comparable to commonly debated decisions regarding time discounting. Additionally, we estimate the avoided mitigation costs implied by plausible reductions in population growth, finding that large near-term savings ($billions annually) occur under TU; savings under AU emerge in the more distant future. These savings are larger than spending shortfalls for human development policies that may lower fertility. Finally, we show that whether lowering population growth entails overall improvements in wellbeing-rather than merely cost savings-again depends on the ethical approach to valuing population.","[Scovronick, Noah; Fleurbaey, Marc; Wagner, Fabian] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Budolfson, Mark B.] Univ Vermont, Dept Philosophy, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Dennig, Francis] Yale NUS Coll, Singapore 138527, Singapore; [Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Ctr Human Values, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Siebert, Asher] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Socolow, Robert H.] Princeton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Spears, Dean] Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, Delhi 110016, India; [Wagner, Fabian] Princeton Univ, Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Wagner, Fabian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria","Scovronick, N (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",Noah.Scovronick@princeton.edu,"Siebert, Asher/W-1615-2019",,,,,47,0,0,2,24,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

To address this, we identify and quantify natural climate solutions (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS-when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation-is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO(2)e) y(-1) (95% Cl 20.3-37.4). This is >= 30% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO(2)e(-1)) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is >= 100 USD MgCO(2)e(-1) by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a >66% chance of holding warming to below 2 degrees C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2-1. Most NCS actions-if effectively implemented-also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.","[Griscom, Bronson W.; Adams, Justin; Ellis, Peter W.; Lomax, Guy; Zganjar, Chris; Elias, Patricia; Gopalakrishna, Trisha; Hamsik, Marisa R.; Kiesecker, Joseph; Landis, Emily; Leavitt, Sara M.; Fargione, Joseph] Nature Conservancy, Arlington, VA 22203 USA; [Griscom, Bronson W.] James Madison Univ, Dept Biol, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Houghton, Richard A.; Sanderman, Jonathan] Woods Hole Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA 02540 USA; [Miteva, Daniela A.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Schlesinger, William H.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA; [Shoch, David] TerraCarbon LLC, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Siikamaki, Juha V.; Blackman, Allen] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Smith, Pete] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Biol & Environm Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; [Woodbury, Peter] Cornell Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Campari, Joao] Govt Brazil, Minist Agr, BR-70000 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Conant, Richard T.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Conant, Richard T.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Delgado, Christopher; Laestadius, Lars; Minnemeyer, Susan] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Herrero, Mario] CSIRO, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Laestadius, Lars] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Dept Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Potapov, Peter] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Putz, Francis E.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Silvius, Marcel] Wetlands Int, NL-6700 AL Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wollenberg, Eva] Univ Vermont, Gund Inst Environm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA","Griscom, BW (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Arlington, VA 22203 USA.; Griscom, BW (corresponding author), James Madison Univ, Dept Biol, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.; Schlesinger, WH (corresponding author), Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY 12545 USA.",bgriscom@tnc.org; schlesingerw@caryinstitute.org,"Woodbury, P.

The study introduces an approach that combines long-run economic growth models, climate models, and reduced-form GIS models. The study demonstrates that social cost-benefit analysis and damage-limiting strategies can be usefully extended to illuminate issues with major long-term consequences, as well as concerns such as potential tipping points, irreversibility, and hysteresis. A key finding is that, under a wide range of assumptions, the risk of GIS disintegration makes a small contribution to the optimal stringency of current policy or to the overall social cost of climate change. It finds that the cost of GIS disintegration adds less than 5% to the social cost of carbon (SCC) under alternative discount rates and estimates of the GIS dynamics.","[Nordhaus, William] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Nordhaus, W (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",william.nordhaus@yale.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Carnegie Foundation,"The author is grateful for helpful comments from many researchers and colleagues.

By putting a price on carbon, carbon markets reshape incentives faced by firms and reduce the value of emissions. How effective are carbon markets? Observers have tended to infer their effectiveness from market prices. The general belief is that a carbon market needs a high price in order to reduce emissions. As a result, many observers remain skeptical of initiatives such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), whose price remained low (compared to the social cost of carbon). In this paper, we assess whether the EU ETS reduced CO2 emissions despite low prices. We motivate our study by documenting that a carbon market can be effective if it is a credible institution that can plausibly become more stringent in the future. In such a case, firms might cut emissions even though market prices are low. In fact, low prices can be a signal that the demand for carbon permits weakens. Thus, low prices are compatible with successful carbon markets. To assess whether the EU ETS reduced carbon emissions even as permits were cheap, we estimate counterfactual carbon emissions using an original sectoral emissions dataset. We find that the EU ETS saved about 1.2 billion tons of CO2 between 2008 and 2016 (3.8%) relative to a world without carbon markets, or almost half of what EU governments promised to reduce under their Kyoto Protocol commitments. Emission reductions in sectors covered under the EU ETS were higher.","[Bayer, Patrick] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Glasgow G1 1QX, Lanark, Scotland; [Aklin, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA","Bayer, P (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Glasgow G1 1QX, Lanark, Scotland.",patrick.bayer@strath.ac.uk,,"Bayer, Patrick/0000-0003-1731-1270",British Academy Small Grant [SG171349],We gratefully acknowledge funding from the British Academy Small Grant SG171349.

In this study, the potential effects of such closures on air quality and human health were analyzed by linking a regional photochemical model with a health impacts assessment tool. The impacts varied significantly across 13 of the state's largest coal-fired power plants, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude, even after normalizing by generation. While some power plants had negligible impacts on concentrations at important monitors, average impacts up to 0.5 parts per billion (ppb) and 0.2 mu g/m(3) and maximum impacts up to 3.3 ppb and 0.9 mu g/m(3) were seen for ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respectively. Individual power plants impacted average visibility by up to 0.25 deciviews in Class I Areas. Health impacts arose mostly from PM2.5 and were an order of magnitude higher for plants that lack scrubbers for SO2. Rankings of health impacts were largely consistent across the base model results and two reduced form models. Carbon dioxide emissions were relatively uniform, ranging from 1.00 to 1.26 short tons/MWh, and can be monetized based on a social cost of carbon. Despite all of these unpaid externalities, estimated direct costs of each power plant exceeded wholesale power prices in 2016. Implications: While their CO2 emission rates are fairly similar, sharply different NOx and SO2 emission rates and spatial factors cause coal-fired power plants to vary by an order of magnitude in their impacts on ozone, particulate matter, and associated health and visibility outcomes. On a monetized basis, the air pollution health impacts often exceed the value of the electricity generated and are of similar magnitude to climate impacts. This suggests that both air pollution and climate should be considered if externalities are used to inform decision making about power-plant dispatch and retirement.","[Strasert, Brian; Teh, Su Chen; Cohan, Daniel S.] Rice Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 6100 Main St,MS 519, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Strasert, Brian] GSI Environm, Houston, TX USA","Cohan, DS (corresponding author), Rice Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 6100 Main St,MS 519, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",cohan@rice.edu,"Cohan, Daniel/E-6595-2010","Cohan, Daniel/0000-0003-0415-7980; Strasert, Brian/0000-0002-7811-4281",National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX15AN63G],This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX15AN63G].,,71,2,2,5,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1096-2247,2162-2906,,J AIR WASTE MANAGE,J.

First, the paradigm shift of the Cancun Agreements is examined from an historical perspective and it is shown that the impasse in the negotiations, caused by the underlying over-emphasis on burden sharing reductions in emissions, can be overcome. Second, using information from two modelling exercises, it is demonstrated how climate finance can encourage the decoupling of carbon emissions from economic growth and thereby help align the development pattern with global climate goals. Third, a framework to place carbon finance within current discussions is sketched regarding both the reformation of the world financial systems and the facilitation of a sustainable economic recovery that is beneficial for North and South while addressing the low-carbon transition. It is concluded that upgrading climate finance is the key to triggering the shift to a low-carbon society and a system is proposed in which an agreed social cost of carbon is used to support the establishment of carbon emissions certificates to reorient a significant portion of global savings towards low-carbon investments. Policy relevance Investments that align development and climate objectives are shown to substantially lower the social cost of carbon and deliver long-term carbon emissions reductions. These reductions are greater than those contributed by the sole carbon price signal generated by a world cap-and-trade system. Carbon finance, as a part of the broader reform of financial systems and overseas aid, can help overcome the dual adversity of climate and financial crisis contexts. The carbon certificate, with an upfront agreed social cost of carbon, can be used as its instrument. The portion of the banking system that intends to reorient a significant part of world savings towards low-carbon investments could thus issue such carbon certificates. By giving carbon assets the status of a reserve currency, the system could even respond to the need of emerging countries to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and trigger a wave of worldwide sustainable growth through infrastructure markets.","[Hourcade, Jean-Charles] CIRED, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Shukla, Priyadarshi] Indian Inst Management, Publ Syst Grp, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India; [Shukla, Priyadarshi] Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China","Hourcade, JC (corresponding author), CIRED, 45 Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",hourcade@centre-cired.fr,,"Shukla, Priyadarshi/0000-0002-7305-2907",,,,56,11,11,3,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

Recently, the US, amongst other nations, has begun to use estimates of the social cost of CO2 (SC-CO2) to develop analyses that more fully capture the climate change impacts of GHG abatement. The SC-CO2 represents the aggregate willingness to pay to avoid the damages associated with an additional tonne of CO2 emissions. In comparison, the social costs of non-CO2 GHGs have received little attention from researchers and policy analysts, despite their non-negligible climate impact. This article addresses this issue by developing a set of social cost estimates for two highly prevalent non-CO2 GHGs, methane and nitrous oxide. By extending existing integrated assessment models, it is possible to develop a set of social cost estimates for these gases that are consistent with the SC-CO2 estimates currently in use by the US federal government.Policy relevanceWithin the benefit-cost analyses that inform the design of major regulations, all Federal agencies within the US Government (USG) use a set of agreed upon SC-CO2 estimates to value the impact of CO2 emissions changes. However, the value of changes in non-CO2 GHG emissions has not been included in USG policy analysis to date. This article addresses that omission by developing a set of social cost estimates for two highly prevalent non-CO2 GHGs, methane and nitrous oxide. These new estimates are designed to be compatible with the USG SC-CO2 estimates currently in use and may therefore be directly applied to value emissions changes for these non-CO2 gases within the benefit-cost analyses used to evaluate future policies.","[Marten, Alex L.; Kopits, Elizabeth A.; Griffiths, Charles W.; Newbold, Stephen C.; Wolverton, Ann] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA","Marten, AL (corresponding author), US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, 1200 Penn Ave, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",marten.alex@epa.gov,,"Marten, Alex/0000-0003-3427-9719",,,,38,16,16,0,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The US social cost of carbon (SCC) methodology is used in innovative ways to value new Earth observing systems (EOSs). The study departs from the strict US SCC methodology, and from previous work, in that net benefits are used instead of only damages to calculate the value of information of the enhanced systems. In other respects the US SCC methodology is followed closely. We compute the surfeit expected net benefits of learning the actionable information earlier, with the enhanced system, versus learning later with existing systems. The enhanced systems are designed to give reliable information about climate sensitivity on accelerated timescales relative to existing systems; therefore, the decision context stipulates that a global reduced emissions path would be deployed upon receiving suitable information on the rate of temperature rise with a suitable level of confidence. By placing the enhanced observing system in a decision context, the SCC enables valuing this system as a real option. Policy relevance Uncertainty in key parameters of the climatic system is often cited as a barrier for near-term reductions of carbon emissions. It is a truism among risk managers that uncertainty costs money, and its reduction has economic value. Advancing policy making under uncertainty requires valuing the reduction in uncertainty. Using CLARREO, a new proposed EOS, as an example, this article applies value of information/real option theory to value the reduction of uncertainty in the decadal rate of temperature rise. The US interagency social cost of carbon directive provides the decision context for the valuations. It is shown that the real option value of the uncertainty reduction, relative to existing observing systems, is a very large multiple of the new system's cost.","[Cooke, Roger] Delft Univ Technol, Resources Future, Univ Strathclyde, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Golub, Alexander] Amer Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Wielicki, Bruce A.; Young, David F.; Mlynczak, Martin G.; Baize, Rosemary R.] NASA, Langley Res Ctr, Sci Directorate, 21 Langley Blvd, Hampton, VA 23681 USA","Golub, A (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Dept Environm Sci, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",agolub@american.edu,"Wielicki, Bruce/AAX-3676-2020; Mlynczak, Martin/K-3396-2012; Golub, Alexander/E-8224-2019","Golub, Alexander/0000-0002-3586-1447",,,,14,6,7,1,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

But from many corners now, it has been argued that these models are inadequate as tools for policy analysis. In particular, extreme impacts of climate change, inherent uncertainty, and discounting have been widely discussed as flaws of current models. Surprisingly, unrealistic assumptions about individual behaviour, which ignore well-documented behavioural anomalies' and social interactions, have attracted little attention so far in the economic analysis of climate change impacts and policies. This article begins to address this gap by providing an overview of formal macro-behavioural models, designed to incorporate a variety of realistic behaviours, such as present bias, habit formation, loss-aversion, and social status into economic theory. We show that ignoring behavioural anomalies may undermine the effectiveness of climate policies, which we illustrate with examples of optimal pollution tax and the social cost of carbon. In addition, we study the probability of the rebound effect in each behavioural model. The rebound effect describes a situation where improvements in energy efficiency render a reduction in energy consumption less than proportional. We show that status concerns make the economy more conducive to the rebound effect compared to a model with fully rational agents. Models of habit formation and loss aversion can have the opposite effect.POLICY RELEVANCECurrent models to assess climate policies may deliver biased insights owing to the omission of essential aspects of bounded rationality. The discounted utility framework, which describes how consumers trade current versus future consumption, is typically used to evaluate climate policies. Climate change economists have largely ignored alternative behavioural models, which integrate into economic theory realistic behaviours, such as: present bias, habit formation, loss-aversion, and social status. This is surprising in the light of evidence that virtually every assumption underlying the discounted utility model has been tested and found to be an invalid description of how people actually behave. We show with examples how well-established anomalies can undermine the effectiveness of climate policies.","[Safarzynska, Karolina] Warsaw Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland","Safarzynska, K (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",ksafarzynska@wne.uw.edu.pl,,"Safarzynska, Karolina/0000-0001-8924-2038; Safarzynska, Karolina/0000-0001-5507-9287","National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2016/21/B/HS4/00647]","The research was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland [grant number 2016/21/B/HS4/00647].",,64,3,3,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

By contrast, technology policies remain the more prominent national climate policy instruments today: renewable energy subsidies amount to more than US$100 billion per year globally - more than twice the value of priced carbon in 2016. Given technology spillovers and global learning effects, it remains unclear how technology policies can be coordinated internationally as part of climate stabilization policy. Our study is the first to derive optimal technology and climate policy for the 2inline-graphic>C target using an energy-economy-climate model. We show an economic rationale to include an international technology protocol alongside carbon pricing: Cumulative low-carbon subsidies of more than US$1 trillion from 2020 until the end of the century mainly support solar power as well as electric- and hydrogen-powered passenger vehicles. Higher carbon pricing could replace subsidies at very low cost, but mitigation cost increases from delayed carbon pricing can be reduced only somewhat by stepping up subsidies. Our study suggests that existing low-carbon subsidies must be complemented by full carbon pricing to achieve 2<C cost-efficiently: Alongside the optimal carbon price, low-carbon subsidies should amount to no more than approximate to 6% of the value of priced carbon.Key policy insights International spillovers in low-carbon technologies may slow their deployment.We derive optimal technology and climate policy for 2C in an energy-economy-climate model.Subsidies of more than US$1 trillion support mainly solar and advanced car technologies.Replacing all subsidies by carbon pricing barely increases mitigation costs.","[Schultes, Anselm; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Secretariat EB 4-1,Str 17,Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Schultes, Anselm; Leimbach, Marian; Luderer, Gunnar; Pietzcker, Robert C.; Baumstark, Lavinia; Bauer, Nico; Kriegler, Elmar; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany","Schultes, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Secretariat EB 4-1,Str 17,Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",schultes@pik-potsdam.de,"Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012; Kriegler, Elmar/I-3048-2016; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Kriegler, Elmar/0000-0002-3307-2647; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,45,1,1,2,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-3062,1752-7457,,CLIM POLICY,Clim.

The consensus agrees to holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5 degrees C. Each Party's successive nationally determined contribution (NDC) will represent a progression beyond the party's then current NDC, and reflect its highest possible ambition. Using Ireland as a test case, we show that increased mitigation ambition is required to meet the Paris Agreement goals in contrast to current EU policy goals of an 80-95% reduction by 2050. For the 1.5 degrees C consistent carbon budgets, the technically feasible scenarios' abatement costs rise to greater than Euro8,100/tCO(2) by 2050. The greatest economic impact is in the short term. Annual GDP growth rates in the period to 2020 reduce from 4% to 2.2% in the 1.5 degrees C scenario. While aiming for net zero emissions beyond 2050, investment decisions in the next 5-10 years are critical to prevent carbon lock-in.Key policy insights Economic growth can be maintained in Ireland while rapidly decarbonizing the energy system.The social cost of carbon needs to be included as standard in valuation of infrastructure investment planning, both by government finance departments and private investors.Technological feasibility is not the limiting factor in achieving rapid deep decarbonization.Immediate increased decarbonization ambition over the next 3-5 years is critical to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, acknowledging the current 80-95% reduction target is not consistent with temperature goals of well below' 2 degrees C and pursuing 1.5 degrees C.Applying carbon budgets to the energy system results in non-linear CO2 emissions reductions over time, which contrast with current EU policy targets, and the implied optimal climate policy and mitigation investment strategy.","[Glynn, James; Gargiulo, Maurizio; Chiodi, Alessandro; Deane, Paul; Rogan, Fionn; Gallachoir, Brian O.] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Glynn, James; Gargiulo, Maurizio; Chiodi, Alessandro; Deane, Paul; Rogan, Fionn; Gallachoir, Brian O.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Cork, Ireland; [Gargiulo, Maurizio; Chiodi, Alessandro] E4SMA Srl, Turin, Italy","Glynn, J (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland.; Glynn, J (corresponding author), Univ Coll Cork, Sch Engn, Cork, Ireland.",james.glynn@ucc.ie,"Chiodi, Alessandro/V-2646-2019; Gargiulo, Maurizio/V-2964-2019","Chiodi, Alessandro/0000-0002-9757-5972; Gargiulo, Maurizio/0000-0001-7735-6441; O Gallachoir, Brian/0000-0002-6608-5997; Deane, Paul/0000-0002-4681-7791; Rogan, Fionn/0000-0002-7050-6301",Science Foundation Ireland as part of the MaREI CentreScience Foundation Ireland [12/RC/2302]; Environmental Protection Agency and Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland under Ireland's Climate Change Research Programme 2007-2013 for the development of the Irish TIMES model [2011-CCRP-MS-3.5]; European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU); Higher Education Authority through the PRTLI-5 Graduate Research Engineering Programme in Energy,This material is based upon works supported by the Science Foundation Ireland as part of the MaREI Centre [grant number 12/RC/2302].

In this paper, we investigate the scope for a targeted price signal to curb emissions growth and help deliver on the country's Paris Agreement pledges. Cost burdens on various income groups are investigated, and experts' opinions are elicited to evaluate two types of carbon price policies (i.e. a carbon tax and an increase in the current ETS price). We use two methodological approaches in this paper. Estimates of the social cost of carbon and the price elasticity of fuel demand are used to understand the mitigation potential of a higher carbon price, while a multi-criteria analysis technique is used to understand experts' preferences between an ETS and a carbon tax. The findings are that with a price elasticity of transport fuel demand of around -0.7, a carbon price between NZD 100 (USD 65) per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO(2)) and NZD 235 (USD 153)/tCO(2) could reduce transport emissions by between 33% and 44% in 2030, respectively, from the 2016 level. The (uncompensated) cost-burdens on lower income households due to a hypothetical price of NZD 100/tCO(2) and NZD 235/tCO(2) are estimated to be around NZD 531 (USD 345)/year and NZD 670 (USD 436)/year per household respectively. Experts marginally favoured a carbon tax over an ETS because the revenue collected through a carbon tax could be utilized in a more holistic way to offset the tax burden on lower income households and fund emissions reduction technologies and infrastructures. Key policy insights A carbon price of NZD 235 (USD 153)/tCO(2) implying a fuel price of NZD 3/litre (USD 1.95/litre) could reduce transport emissions by 44% in 2030 from the 2016 level. A fuel price of NZD 3/litre is comparable to fuel prices in the early 1980s, when these were at a historic high. A carbon price of NZD 235 (USD 153) would increase the annual domestic transport expenditure of lower income households by NZD 670 (USD 436), a 42% increase. A carbon tax is marginally preferred by interviewed experts to an increase in prices under the current ETS.","[Hasan, Md Arif; Chapman, Ralph; Archie, Kelli M.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand; [Frame, David J.; Archie, Kelli M.] Victoria Univ Wellington, New Zealand Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand","Hasan, MA (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",arif_hasan_urp@yahoo.com,"Frame, Dave/R-6169-2016","Frame, Dave/0000-0002-0949-3994; Archie, Kelli/0000-0001-9348-8073; Hasan, Md.

Current practices for transparency focus on making model source code and data available, documenting key equations and parameter values, and ensuring replicability of results. We argue that, even when followed, these guidelines are insufficient for achieving deep transparency, in the sense that results often remain driven by implicit value-laden assumptions that are opaque to other modellers and researchers, and that may not be understood by wider audiences to be controversial. This paper identifies additional best practices for achieving transparency by highlighting issues where disagreement over value judgements will persist for the foreseeable future. Recommendations for deepening transparency are developed by learning from successes and ongoing challenges represented in three case studies. We provide recommendations to accelerate the adoption of additional best practices for deepening transparency of energy and environmental modelling in policy-relevant domains, increasing stakeholder participation with non-modellers, and encouraging interdisciplinary dialogue. Key policy insights Achieving all of the goals associated with transparency requires more than current practices of providing open source data, code, and model documentation. Greater interdisciplinary dialogue could improve transparency beyond current practices, including in model development, application, and communications. Better practices for addressing contentious and value-laden assumptions include providing accessible documentation for non-specialists, increasing policymaker participation to ensure that model outputs can inform questions, and performing sensitivity analyses that cover a range of reasonable views about value-laden assumptions.

The system consists of a geographical information system (GIS) and a multi-objective optimization model. The GIS is designed to measure and quantify business commute attributes such as emissions, commute cost, and time of each commute option. The multi-objective optimization model is designed to generate optimal trade-offs among two optimization objectives (1) minimizing equivalent social cost of GHG emissions and air pollution, and (2) minimizing total commute time of business commuters. Performance of the system is evaluated and verified using a case study of 21 commuters. Results show the capabilities of the new system in identifying Pareto-optimal solutions of the two optimization objectives for various tolerances of commute time increase ranging from 5 to 25 min.

However, and despite the positive role that trade may play in improving growth through better allocation of domestic resources and lower costs of imported equipments and raw materials, the risk is to amplify output in sectors intensive in energy in a country where energy is still subsidized. Introducing pollution abatement taxation has been suggested as a way to achieve ancillary benefits from reduced local air toxics. The highest level of local air pollution is found in heavily populated cities where labor is concentrated and where labor health is believed to have been significantly impacted. The objective of this paper is to address this important issue. It identifies the optimal and 'no regrets' pollution abatement tax on a net welfare function, which integrates both net health benefits and adjustment costs. The paper uses a Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for the assessment that allows the health benefits to feed back into the economy. A health effects submodel takes the local air emissions output from the CGE model and assesses the implications for ambient air concentration levels and health effects. The results suggest an 'optimal' abatement rate in 2020 of around 25% of CO2 reduction compared with the baseline 2020 emissions. However, the most significant impact concerns the relatively small aggregate cost of pollution abatement in terms of forgone real average growth rate of GDP between 2010 and 2020 for the trade scenario with 'optimal' climate policy. Finally, the major consequence of pollution abatement policies is the reduction of production generated by polluting activities against a higher production of less-polluting activities.","[Chemingui, Mohamed Abdelbasset] United Nations Econ Commiss Afr, Trade Finances & Econ Dev Div, Nabeul, Tunisia; [Thabet, Chokri] Inst Super Agron Chott Meriem, Dept Econ & Developpement Rural, Sousse, Tunisia","Chemingui, MA (corresponding author), United Nations Econ Commiss Afr, Trade Finances & Econ Dev Div, Nabeul, Tunisia.",mohamed_chemingui@yahoo.fr,,,Economic Research Forum [2009-015],This work was supported by the Economic Research Forum (grant number 2009-015).,,29,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1793-8120,1793-8171,,MIDDLE EAST DEV J,Middle East Dev.

While agriculture is a substantial source of emissions, it is also generally considered to be a potential source of cost-effective non-CO2 GHG abatement. Previous bottom-up analyses provided marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves for use in modeling these options within economy-wide and global mitigation analyses. In this paper, we utilize updated economic and biophysical data and models developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate regional mitigation potential for major sources of agricultural GHG emissions. In addition, we explore mitigation potential available at costs at or below the estimated benefits of mitigation, as represented by the social cost of carbon. Key enhancements over previous regional assessments include incorporation of additional mitigation options, updated baseline emissions projections, greater spatial disaggregation, and development of MAC curves through 2030. For croplands and rice cultivation, biophysical, process-based models (DAYCENT and DNDC) are used to simulate yields and net GHG emissions under baseline and mitigation scenarios while the livestock sector is modeled by applying key mitigation options to baselines compiled by EPA. MAC curves are generated accounting for net GHG reductions, yield effects, livestock productivity effects, commodity prices, labor requirements, and capital costs where appropriate. MAC curves are developed at the regional level and reveal large potential for non-CO2 GHG mitigation at low carbon prices, especially in Asia.","[Beach, Robert H.] RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Creason, Jared; Ohrel, Sara Bushey; Ragnauth, Shaun] US EPA, Washington, DC 20460 USA; [Ogle, Stephen] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Li, Changsheng] Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Complex Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Ingraham, Pete; Salas, William] Appl GeoSolut LLC, Durham, NH USA","Beach, RH (corresponding author), RTI Int, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA.",rbeach@rti.org,,"Beach, Robert/0000-0001-8549-8546; Ragnauth, Shaun/0000-0001-8370-7025; Ogle, Stephen/0000-0003-1899-7446; Ingraham, Peter/0000-0001-7070-604X","US Environmental Protection Agency, Climate Change Division [EP-BPA-12-H-0023, EP-B14H-00217]","This work was supported by the US Environmental Protection Agency, Climate Change Division [contract number EP-BPA-12-H-0023, Call Order EP-B14H-00217].

Global 4C offers a financial reward for mitigation and aims to internalise a Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) into the economy. Carbon taxes (i.e. carbon prices) are essential for internalising the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), however a SCC-RCC duality is inferred with an epistemological method and is supported with a new hypothesis, called the Holistic Market Hypothesis. Based on the inferred SCC-RCC duality, a system of complementary market pricing is proposed as an effective response to emerging climate systemic risk and fat-tailed probability distributions for the Earth's climate sensitivity. The recommended policy instrument is a currency, called Complementary Currencies for Climate Change (4C). 4C should be priced in foreign exchange currency markets (Forex) to mirror the RCC and to incentivise a spectrum of mitigation services, including clean renewable energy and carbon sequestration. A public broadcast message for climate systemic risk should be made each year, in the form of a '100-year advance 4C price alert', which is an assurance of reward prices for carbon mitigation (i.e. the 4C exchange rate) under a Carbon Exchange Standard (CES). The CES is a macro-prudential protocol for central banks to provide collective insurability against climate catastrophe and incentives for socio-ecological co-benefits.","[Chen, Delton B.; Cloud, Jonathan] Ctr Regenerat Community Solut 501 C 3, 8 Revere Dr, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920 USA; [van der Beek, Joel] EconoVis, Econ Res & Consultancy, Doorn, Netherlands","Chen, DB (corresponding author), Ctr Regenerat Community Solut 501 C 3, 8 Revere Dr, Basking Ridge, NJ 07920 USA.",deltonchen@crcsolutions.org,,,,,,133,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2043-0795,2043-0809,,J SUSTAIN FINANC INV,J.

We show that the models used by the IWG assume continued economic growth in the face of substantial temperature increases, which suggests that they may not capture the full range of possible consequences of climate change. Using the DICE integrated assessment model, we examine the possibility that climate change may directly affect productivity and find that even a modest impact of this type increases SCC estimates substantially. The SCC appears to be highly uncertain and sensitive to modeling assumptions. Understanding the impact of climate change therefore requires understanding how climate-related harms may affect productivity and economic growth.

The performance of the simple rule is excellent and yields only negligible welfare losses compared with the true welfare optimum under a wide range of perturbations including some extreme runs designed to severely road test the rule. Our IAM allows for scarce fossil fuel and endogenous energy transitions and generates cumulative carbon emissions and stranded assets which are also well predicted by our rule.","[Rezai, Armon] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Rezai, Armon] IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Van der Ploeg, Frederick] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Van der Ploeg, Frederick] St Petersburg State Univ, 7-9 Univ Skaya Nab, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Van der Ploeg, Frederick] Vrije Univ VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Rezai, A (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.; Rezai, A (corresponding author), IIASA, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",armon.rezai@wu.ac.at; rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,Austrian National Bank (OeNB) Anniversary Fund [15330]; Schrodinger fellowship of Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J 3633]; European Research Council (ERC)European Research Council (ERC) [269788],"Rezai is grateful for financial support from the Austrian National Bank (OeNB) Anniversary Fund (grant no. 15330) and the Schrodinger fellowship of Austrian Science Fund (FWF): J 3633.

The model highlights the source of debate over whether countries should use the global or domestic SCC for regulatory impact analysis. I identify conditions under which a country's decision to internalize the global SCC is individually rational. I show that obtaining international consensus on a uniform value to internalize will be more challenging than often appreciated. I introduce the notion of a preferred SCC to reflect each country's preference conditional on a true value of the global SCC and a distribution of the domestic SCCs among countries. While all countries have a preferred SCC greater than their domestic SCC, a country's preferred SCC can be greater than or less than the global SCC. How these preferences translate into agreement depends on institutional arrangements for collective decision making, for which I provide empirical evidence based on various decision rules.","[Kotchen, Matthew J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Kotchen, MJ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.; Kotchen, MJ (corresponding author), NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",matthew.kotchen@yale.edu,,,,,,36,7,7,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Our results suggest that inequality considerations lead to higher (lower) social cost of carbon values in high (low) income regions relative to an efficiency based approach, but that the effect is less strong than found in previous studies that used equity weighting.

Much climate policy discourse has been based on the equilibrium global mean temperature increase following a concentration stabilization scenario. This is determined by the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) which, in many studies, shows persistent, fat-tailed uncertainty. However, for many purposes, the equilibrium response is less relevant than the transient response. Here, we show that one prominent policy variable, the social cost of carbon (SCC), is generally better constrained by the transient climate response (TCR) than by the ECS. Simple analytic expressions show the SCC to be directly proportional to the TCR under idealized assumptions when the rate at which we discount future damage equals 2.8%. Using ensemble simulations of a simple climate model we find that knowing the true value of the TCR can reduce the relative uncertainty in the SCC substantially more, up to a factor of 3, than knowing the ECS under typical discounting assumptions. We conclude that the TCR, which is better constrained by observations, less subject to fat-tailed uncertainty and more directly related to the SCC, is generally preferable to the ECS as a single proxy for the climate response in SCC calculations.","[Otto, Alexander; Allen, Myles R.] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Todd, Benjamin J.; Bowerman, Niel] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Frame, David J.] Victoria Univ Wellington, NZ Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand; [Frame, David J.] Univ Oxford, Smith Sch Enterprise & Environm, Oxford OX1 2BQ, England; [Frame, David J.; Allen, Myles R.] Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 3PU, England","Otto, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",alexander.otto@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Frame, Dave/R-6169-2016; Frame, Dave/A-8918-2014","Frame, Dave/0000-0002-0949-3994; ",,,,30,2,2,0,19,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

This is referred to as leakage. Leakage can offset or augment emissions reductions associated with a policy, which has important environmental and economic implications. Although leakage has been studied at national levels, analysis of leakage for subnational policies is limited. This is despite greater market integration and many existing state and regional environmental regulations in the US. This study explores leakage potential, net emissions changes, and other social implications in the US energy system with regionally differentiated pricing of power sector CO2 emissions. We undertake an economic analysis using EPRI's US-REGEN model, where power sector CO2 emissions are priced in individual US regions with a range of social cost of carbon (SCC) values. SCC estimates are being considered by policy-makers for valuing potential societal damages from CO2 emissions. In this study, we evaluate the emissions implications within the SCC pricing region, within the power sector outside the SCC region, and outside the power sector (i.e. in the rest of the energy system). Results indicate that CO2 leakage is possible within and outside the electric sector, ranging from negative 70% to over 80% in our scenarios, with primarily positive leakage outcomes. Typically ignored in policy analysis, leakage would affect CO2 reduction benefits. We also observe other potential societal effects within and across regions, such as higher electricity prices, changes in power sector investments, and overall consumption losses. Efforts to reduce leakage, such as constraining power imports into the SCC pricing region likely reduce leakage, but could also result in lower net emissions reductions, as well as larger price increases. Thus, it is important to look beyond leakage and consider a broader set of environmental and economic metrics. Leakage rates, net emissions outcomes, electricity price changes, fuel market effects, and macroeconomic costs vary by region of the country, time, policy stringency, policy design (e.g. leakage mitigation provisions), policy environment in neighboring regions, and price responsiveness of demand.","[Bistline, John E.; Rose, Steven K.] Elect Power Res Inst, 3412 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Bistline, JE (corresponding author), Elect Power Res Inst, 3412 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",jbistline@epri.com,,"Bistline, John/0000-0003-4816-5739",,,,18,5,5,3,13,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,,,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

While the potential for solar PV in the residential and commercial sectors has been widely studied, the potential in educational buildings is largely unknown. Educational institutions account for 11% of total US building electricity consumption and 14% of building floorspace. These buildings also contribute to approximately 4% of total USCO2 emissions, thus playing a potentially important role in climate mitigation strategies. We estimate the electricity use for 132k educational institutions across the US and estimate electricity generation, greenhouse gas and health damaging air emissions reductions, and private and social costs and benefits that would result from adopting rooftop solar PV. We find that solar PV in US educational institutions could provide 100 TWh of electricity services annually, meeting 75% of these buildings' current electricity consumption. We estimate the highest generation potential in Texas, California, and Florida with K-12 public educational institutions comprising the bulk of that generation. The provision of electricity services from rooftop solar PV on educational institutions could reduce health, environmental, and climate change damages by roughly $4 billion per year (assuming a social cost of carbon of $40/ton and value of statistical life of $10M in 2018 USD). Two key findings from this study are that: (i) the private costs of solar for educational institutions still exceed the private benefits from reduced electricity consumption across the entire country (unless a third party operation model is used, in which case some locations can have net-benefits), and (ii) with the exceptions of California and New York, the social health, environmental and climate change benefits exceed the levels of current incentives provided by the state and retail subsidies.","[Hanus, Nichole L.; Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle; Vaishnav, Parth T.; Azevedo, Ines L.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 129 Baker Hall,5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Darghouth, Naim R.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Azevedo, IL (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 129 Baker Hall,5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",iazevedo@cmu.edu,,"Vaishnav, Parth/0000-0003-1582-4523; Azevedo, Ines/0000-0002-4755-8656",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE1252522]; Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University; center for Climate and Energy Decision Making (CEDM) [SES-00949710],"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE1252522.

We study consumer preferences for combustion fuels including gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) using consumer choice survey data from two settings: online (n = 331) and in-person at refueling stations (n = 127). Light-duty vehicle owners were asked in a series of choice tasks to choose among fuels that varied in type, price, CO2 emissions, and location of origin for a hypothetical vehicle that could accept all fuels. We find that the majority of gasoline and E85 users are willing to substitute towards other fuels at today's prices and attributes, while diesel users have a strong preference for diesel fuel. We also find that respondents are willing to pay on average $150/ton CO2 avoided from fuel consumption-more than most estimates of the social cost of carbon. Thus, communicating the climate benefits from alternative fuels may be an important strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector.","[Helveston, John P.] George Washington Univ, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 800 22nd St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Seki, Stephanie M.; Michalek, Jeremy J.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Min, Jihoon] IIASA, Energy Program, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Fairman, Evelyn] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Energy Sci Technol & Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Boni, Arthur A.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Michalek, Jeremy J.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Azevedo, Ines M.

These emissions result in environmental externalities primarily in terms of climate and air quality. Here we quantify the cost of co-pollutant emissions per ton of CO2 emissions from US electric power generation. We measure the co-pollutant cost of carbon (CPCC) as the total value of statistical life associated with US-based premature mortalities attributable to co-pollutant emissions, per mass of CO2. We find an average CPCC of similar to$45 per metric ton (mt) of CO2 for the year 2011 (in 2017 USD). This is similar to 20% higher than the central Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) measure of climate damages that was used by the Obama administration in its regulatory impact analysis for the Clean Power Plan (CPP), and >8 times higher than the SCC used by the Trump administration in its analysis for the Plan's repeal. At the state-level, the CPCC ranged from similar to$7/mt CO2 for Arizona to similar to$96/mt CO2 for New Jersey. We calculate the CPCC trends from 2002 to 2017 and find a 71% decrease at the national level, contributing to total savings of similar to$1 trillion in averted mortality from power plant emissions over this period. By decomposing the aggregate and fuel-specific co-pollutant intensities into simultaneous (CO2-driven) and autonomous components, we conclude that the CPCC trends originated mainly from targeted efforts to reduce co-pollutant emissions, e.g. through fuel switching (from coal to natural gas) and autonomous changes in co-pollutant emissions. The results suggest that the overall benefit to society from policies to curtail carbon emissions maybe enhanced by focusing on pollution sources where the associated air-quality co-benefits are greatest. At the same time, continued efforts to reduce co-pollutant intensities, if technologically feasible, could help to mitigate the air-quality damages of the CPP's repeal and replacement.","[Dedoussi, Irene C.; Allroggen, Florian; Barrett, Steven R.

At the domestic scale, WEF trade-offs are fairly limited; while all sectors require considerable amounts of energy, the requirements for water and food production are modest compared to other uses. At the international scale, revenues from oil exports in the GCC allow the region to compensate for low food production and scarce water availability. This dependency is dynamic over time, increasing when oil prices are low and food prices are high. We show how reducing domestic trade-offs can lead to higher exposure internationally, with rice imports originating in regions where groundwater is being depleted. However, Saudi Arabia's increased wheat imports, after reversing its food self-sufficiency policy, have had limited effects on groundwater depletion elsewhere. Climate change mitigation links the WEF nexus to the global scale. While there is great uncertainty about future international climate policy, our analysis illustrates how implementation of measures to account for the social costs of carbon would reduce the oil and gas revenues available to import food and desalinate water in the GCC.","[Siderius, Christian; Conway, Declan; Lostis, Pierre-Louis] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Siderius, Christian] Uncharted Waters Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yassine, Mohamed] Amer Univ Cairo, Sch Sci & Engn, New Cairo 11835, Egypt; [Murken, Lisa] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Dalin, Carole] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, London, England","Siderius, C (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.; Siderius, C (corresponding author), Uncharted Waters Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",christian.siderius@unchartedwatersresearch.org,,"Siderius, christian/0000-0002-2201-9728",Kuwait Programme; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy [ES/R009708/1],"CS, DC, PL and LM's contributions to the paper were supported by the Kuwait Programme, a hub for research and expertise on Kuwait based in the LSE Middle East Centre.

The objective of this paper is to develop an integrated approach to quantitatively derive changes in forest carbon stock and changes in the economic value of forest carbon due to deforestation. Combining the best available remote sensing and socioeconomic datasets, this approach establishes a comprehensive baseline of deforestation in terms of area, carbon and monetary value change. We applied this end-to-end evaluation method in the Brazilian state of Rondonia to assess the ecological and economic effects of its recent deforestation from 2000 to 2005. Our results suggest that deforestation occurred at an average rate of 2834 km(2)/yr during the study period, leading to 31 TgC/yr committed carbon emissions from deforestation. Coupling with the social cost of carbon at $23/tC and a market discount rate at 7%, this translates to $622 million U.S. dollars/yr loss in the economic value of forest carbon.","[Song, X.

In addition to mitigating the pollution externality of conventional energy, clean energy mandates have the goal of promoting research and development (R&D) investments in renewable energy technology. But how well do mandates perform as innovation incentives? To address this question, we develop a partial equilibrium model to examine the R&D incentives induced by a mandate, and compare this policy to two benchmark situations: laissez faire and a carbon tax. Innovation is stochastic and the model permits an endogenous number of multiple innovators. We present both analytical results and conclusions based on numerical simulations. We find that the optimal mandate is larger than it would be without the prospect of innovation, that neglecting the outlook for innovation significantly reduces welfare, and that the optimal mandate is more sensitive to assumptions about the innovation process than an optimal carbon tax. Furthermore, we find that mandates create relatively strong incentives for R&D investment in low-quality innovations, but relatively weak incentives to invest in high-quality innovations. We also rank policies by expected welfare. An optimal carbon tax has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate, and both have higher expected welfare than laissez faire. Moreover, in our endogenous innovation setting, a stronger result obtains: a simple carbon tax equal to the damage from pollution (unadjusted for the prospect of innovation) has higher expected welfare than an optimal mandate.","[Clancy, Matthew S.] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Sci & Technol Policy, Ames, IA USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA","Clancy, MS (corresponding author), ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",matthew.clancy@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,36,0,0,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

However, whether all of these measures will prove effective remains to be seen, as free allocation of allowances and financial compensation to energy-intensive industries will raise the overall cost to society without conferring any tangible benefits to the environment.

Cost-benefit analysis would set the optimal amount of greenhouse-gas-emission reduction at the point where this social cost just equals the incremental cost of controlling emissions. The higher the value for the social cost of carbon, the more control is warranted. This comparison assumes that cost-benefit analysis is the correct way of determining climate-change policy, and many believe this is not the case because of the very long-term, irreversible, and potentially catastrophic nature of global warming. But, in the short run at least, a comparison of cost and benefits is required, and, in any event, all decisions imply costs and benefits. But what is the 'right' figure for the social cost of carbon? This paper reviews the UK government's assessment of the cost and concludes that it has been set far too high because of a misreading of the integrated assessment models used to balance costs and benefits. Moreover, adoption of the UK government's shadow price would have formidable implications for energy policy in the UK, and for policies on afforestation.","UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England; UCL, CSERGE, London WC1E 6BT, England; Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England","Pearce, D (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1E 6BT, England.",,,,,,,71,153,161,1,59,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Current estimates indicate that climate change will likely have a limited impact on the economy and human welfare in the twenty-first century. In fact, the initial impacts of climate change may well be positive. However, in the long run the negative impacts dominate the positive ones. Negative impacts will be substantially greater in poorer, hotter, and lower-lying countries. Poverty reduction complements greenhouse gas emissions reduction as a means to reduce climate change impacts. Although climate change may affect the growth rate of the global economy and may trap more people in poverty, quantification of these impacts remains difficult. The optimal carbon tax in the near term is somewhere between a few tens and a few hundreds of dollars per ton of carbon.","[Tol, Richard S.

This article sets out a framework for measuring the cost effectiveness of alternative policies-both command-and-control and incentive-based-in the Brazilian Amazon. First, I estimate the demand for deforestation on private properties, exploiting regional variation in transportation costs as a means to recover farmers' responses to permanent policies. Here, rescaling transportation costs using local yields allows me to express changes in farmers' valuations in dollars per hectare. I then use the estimated demand to infer farmers' willingness to deforest under different counterfactual policies, such as payments to avoid deforestation and taxes on land use, along with the corresponding potential farmers' lost surpluses. The results indicate that payment programmes and land use taxes on agricultural land can be highly effective in preserving the rainforest and also be substantially less expensive than command-and-control policies (approximately 8 times less costly). A carbon tax equal to the social cost of carbon could virtually eliminate all agricultural land in the Amazon, given the low agricultural returns there.","[Souza-Rodrigues, Eduardo] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Souza-Rodrigues, E (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,Charles V.

The literature on optimal carbon pricing often abstracts from other taxes. However, when governments raise revenues with distortionary taxes, carbon levies have fiscal impacts. While they raise revenues directly, they may shrink the bases of other taxes (e.g. by decreasing employment). This article theoretically characterizes and then quantifies optimal carbon taxes in a dynamic general equilibrium climate-economy model with distortionary fiscal policy. First, this article establishes a novel theoretical relationship between the optimal taxation of carbon and of capital income. This link arises because carbon emissions destroy natural capital: they accumulate in the atmosphere and decrease future output. Consequently, this article shows how the standard logic against capital income taxes extends to distortions on environmental capital investments. Second, this article characterizes optimal climate policy in sub-optimal fiscal settings where income taxes are constrained to remain at their observed levels. Third, this article presents a detailed calibration that builds on the seminal DICE approach but adds features essential for a setting with distortionary taxes, such as a differentiation between climate change production impacts (e.g. on agriculture) and direct utility impacts (e.g. on biodiversity existence value). The central quantitative finding is that optimal carbon tax schedules are 8-24% lower when there are distortionary taxes, compared to the setting with lump-sum taxes considered in the literature.","[Barrage, Lint] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Barrage, Lint] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Barrage, L (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.; Barrage, L (corresponding author), NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,100,2,2,17,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Within climate economics, debate on this question has been focused on so-called ethical parameters of social time preference and inequality aversion. We show that optimal climate policy similarly importantly depends on the future of the developing world. In particular, although global poverty is falling and the economic lives of the poor are improving worldwide, leading models of climate economics may be too optimistic about two central predictions: future population growth in poor countries, and future convergence in total factor productivity (TFP). We report results of small modifications to a standard model: under plausible scenarios for high future population growth (especially in sub-Saharan Africa) and for low future TFP convergence, we find that optimal near-term carbon taxes could be substantially larger.","[Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Econ Dept, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Spears, Dean] Indian Stat Inst, Delhi, India; [Budolfson, Mark] Univ Vermont, Philosophy Dept, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Dennig, Francis] Yale NUS Coll Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ USA; [Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Ctr Human Values, Princeton, NJ USA; [Scovronick, Noah] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Siebert, Asher] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wagner, Fabian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria","Spears, D (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Econ Dept, Austin, TX 78712 USA.; Spears, D (corresponding author), Indian Stat Inst, Delhi, India.",dean@riceinstitute.org; Mark.Budolfson@uvm.edu; fdennig@yale-nus.edu.sg; mfleurba@princeton.edu; Noah.Scovronick@princeton.edu; asiebert@iri.columbia.edu; fabian@iiasa.ac.at,"Siebert, Asher/W-1615-2019","Wagner, Fabian/0000-0003-3429-2374; Scovronick, Noah/0000-0003-1410-3337",Population Research Center - Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P2CHD042849],"Dean Spears (corresponding author) is an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department of the University of Texas at Austin and a visiting economist at the Indian Statistical Institute in Delhi; his email address is dean@riceinstitute.org.Mark Budolfson is an Assistant Professor in the Philosophy Department at the University of Vermont; his email address isMark.Budolfson@uvm.edu.Francis Dennig is an Assistant Professor at Yale-NUS College in Singapore; his email address is fdennig@yale-nus.edu.sg.Marc Fleurbaey is Robert E.

When assessing the sustainability of any design or project, one of the key emerging considerations is the potential for the decision to contribute to greenhouse house gas (GHG) emissions. Changes in climate may also lead to new project risks with further economic implications. Design/methodology/approach - Examination of the wider social economic implications of climate change provides the basis for considering individual projects within the context of the social costs of carbon emissions, the prospect of the gradual internalisation of those costs, and the costs and benefits of adaptation to protect against the impacts of global change on the project. Findings - Emissions of greenhouse gases, still widely not priced in many parts of the world, drive the emerging observed and predicted effects of climate change on the planet. This damage has real value and can be monetised, allowing a notional social cost of carbon to be estimated. As climate change continues to manifest itself, societies start to react, constraining emissions and creating a market price or tax for carbon. If economic analysis for project decision making includes an explicit consideration of the likely future trajectory of carbon prices, and also examines the wider external social costs of carbon, the benefits of early adoption of revenue-positive measures to reduce emissions are revealed. In the same way, the financial costs of procrastination are made increasingly evident as regulatory and economic baselines shift. Designing for inevitable climate change will also help industry future-proof their operations. Practical implications - At present, relatively few organisations examine the financial and economic implications of carbon emissions or the effects of a changing climate on their operations. To avoid unnecessary costs, and maximise benefit for stakeholders, decision making for business and government needs to incorporate an explicit economic treatment of the current and likely future implications of operating in a climate-constrained and climate-impacted world. Originality/value - By conducting the kind of analysis proposed, organisations can not only help to reduce GHG emissions, but can also improve their own financial performance. The value of this analysis will only increase over the coming decades of the climate-change era.","[Hardisty, Paul E.] WorleyParsons, Sustainabil & Econ, Perth, WA, Australia; [Hardisty, Paul E.] Imperial Coll London, Environm Engn, London, England; [Hardisty, Paul E.] Univ Western Australia, Environm Engn, Perth, WA, Australia","Hardisty, PE (corresponding author), WorleyParsons, Sustainabil & Econ, Perth, WA, Australia.",paul.hardisty@worleyparsons.com,,,,,,39,1,1,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-7835,1758-6119,,MANAG ENVIRON QUAL,Manag.

The authors review the existing literature and the strengths and deficiencies of existing approaches. They introduce a simple methodology that estimates the amount of legal looting in the fossil fuel industry as an alternative approach to calculate an unpaid social cost of carbon. The looting amount can be defined as society's failure to charge fossil fuel firms for the damage that their activities cause represents an implied subsidy. Design/methodology/approach The methodology used in this paper combines decisions in the form of policymakers setting carbon taxes and rational investors investing in carbon emission markets. Findings The authors show that the unpaid social cost of carbon in the fossil fuel industry was US$12.7tn over 1995-2013, but may be as high as US$115.5tn. Originality/value Over the same period, the sum of industry profits, emission trading scheme carbon permit and carbon tax revenue totalled US$7tn, indicating the industry would not be viable if it was made to pay for damages to society.","[Linnenluecke, Martina] Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Smith, Tom] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Whaley, Robert E.] Vanderbilt Univ, Owen Grad Sch Management, Nashville, TN USA","Smith, T (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",tom.smith@mq.edu.au,"; Linnenluecke, Martina/J-7237-2013","Smith, Tom/0000-0002-1881-9570; Linnenluecke, Martina/0000-0001-7984-9717",,,,40,5,5,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1030-9616,1839-5465,,ACCOUNT RES J,Account.

Based on this model, the government's optimal carbon-emission tax scheme and the company's optimal transportation mode and production decisions are explored. We find that: 1) whether or not the transport carbon-emission tax can increase social welfare depends on the relationships among the social cost of carbon (SCC), the transportation mode shifting threshold (TMST), and the biggest carbon-emission tax that a company can afford (BCRA); 2) a greater SCC implies a higher probability of improving social welfare via imposing transportation carbon-emission tax; and 3) a smaller TMST or BCRA yields a higher probability of improving social welfare when a carbon-emission tax is imposed. Further study shows that imposing a carbon-emission tax on the product with a higher production cost, a bigger product volume, or a bigger product density can increase the probability of improving social welfare.","[Wang, Mingzheng; Liu, Kuan] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Choi, Tsan-Ming] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yue, Xiaohang] Univ Wisconsin, Sheldon B Lubar Sch Business, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA","Choi, TM (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Text & Clothing, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jason.choi@polyu.edu.hk,"Choi, Tsan-Ming/P-6065-2014","Choi, Tsan-Ming/0000-0003-3865-7043",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71171027]; Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71421001]; Key project of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71431002]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University in Ministry of EducationProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-12-0081]; Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University [LJQ2012004]; Fund for International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71110107024];  [PolyU 155013/14B],"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71171027, in part by the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71421001, in part by the Key project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71431002, in part by the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University in Ministry of Education under Grant NCET-12-0081, and in part by the Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University under Grant LJQ2012004.

Using data from recent oil sands projects and estimates of both the social costs of carbon and carbon prices consistent with meeting global climate change targets, we estimate the potential impact of action on climate change on the economic viability of oil sands investments. Our results indicate that oil sands are a marginal resource before they incur any carbon costs. Incorporating carbon costs, we find that the viability of oil sands depends on the coverage of carbon pricing across the life cycle emissions from oil sands and on the equilibrium incidence of carbon prices on producers. We show an important interaction between resource royalties and carbon charges that implies that the impact carbon pricing depends on not only the stringency and coverage of the carbon price but also its point of application of a carbon price. Finally, we explore the potential for technological change to mitigate the impacts of carbon pricing on oil sands investment viability. Resume Cesser l'exploitation ? Le developpement des sables bitumineux avec la tarification du carbone. Dans cet article, nous evaluons l'effet de l'internalisation des couts externes des emissions de carbone pour les nouveaux projets de sables bitumineux. Grace aux donnees provenant de projets industriels recents, ainsi que diverses estimations relatives aux cout sociaux du carbone et sa tarification a l'aune des objectifs en matiere de changement climatique mondiaux, nous evaluons les consequences potentielles des mesures en faveur du climat sur la viabilite economique de nouveaux investissements dans les sables bitumineux. Nos resultats indiquent que ces derniers representent une ressource marginale avant meme d'engager les couts lies au carbone. En ajoutant ces couts, nous constatons que la viabilite des sables bitumineux depend de la couverture des prix du carbone pour les emissions generees par les sites d'exploitation sur l'ensemble de leur cycle de vie, ainsi que de l'incidence d'equilibre des tarifs du carbone sur les producteurs. Nous montrons une interaction importante entre redevances petrolieres et taxes sur le carbone : les consequences liees a la tarification du carbone ne dependent donc pas seulement de la couverture des prix du carbone et des exigences y afferant, mais egalement du point d'application d'un tarif du carbone. Enfin, nous explorons la possibilite d'une evolution technologique permettant d'attenuer les consequences des taxes carbone sur la viabilite des investissements dans les sables bitumineux.","[Boskovic, Branko; Leach, Andrew] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Leach, A (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",aleach@ualberta.ca,,,,,,56,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

But the marginal external cost is often difficult to estimate. This is especially the case when it comes to climate change; estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) range from around $10 per metric ton to well over $200 per metric ton, and there has been little or no movement toward a consensus number. Partly as a result, rather than an SCC-based carbon tax, climate policy has focused on a set of targets that would put limits on temperature increases or atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which in turn imply targets for emission reductions. Economics, however, can tell us little about whether such targets are socially optimal. I discuss the trade-off between taxes versus targets as the focus of policy, explain why it has been so difficult to estimate a marginal SCC, and suggest an approach to estimating an average SCC through the use of expert elicitation. I argue that such an approach could serve as the basis for a harmonized carbon tax.","[Pindyck, Robert S.] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Pindyck, RS (corresponding author), MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,33,7,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2017,84,335,,,,,345,364,,10.1111/ecca.12243,,,20,Economics,Business & Economics,EW9FM,WOS:000402822200001,,Bronze,,,9/30/2020

The paper postulates the conceptually useful allegory of a futuristic World Climate Assembly' (WCA) that votes for a single worldwide price on carbon emissions via the basic democratic principle of one person, one vote majority rule. A WCA-like uniform price-tax counters self-interest by incentivizing countries or agents to internalize the externality because each WCA agent's higher abatement cost from a higher emissions price is counterbalanced by that agent's extra benefit from inducing all other WCA agents to simultaneously lower their emissions in response to the higher price. The paper derives fresh insights and new simple formulae that relate each emitter's most-preferred world price of carbon to the world social cost of carbon' (SCC), and further relates the WCA-voted world price of carbon to the world SCC. Some implications are discussed. The overall methodology of the paper is a mixture of mostly classical with some behavioural economics.","[Weitzman, Martin L.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Weitzman, ML (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,34,4,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2017,84,336,,,,,559,586,,10.1111/ecca.12248,,,28,Economics,Business & Economics,FF3OI,WOS:000408815800001,,Green Published,,,9/30/2020

Thus, biodiversity loss is likely creating an ecosystem service debt: a gradual loss of biodiversity-dependent benefits that people obtain from remaining fragments of natural ecosystems. Here, we develop an approach for quantifying ecosystem service debts, and illustrate its use to estimate how one anthropogenic driver, habitat destruction, could indirectly diminish one ecosystem service, carbon storage, by creating an extinction debt. We estimate that c.2-21 Pg C could be gradually emitted globally in remaining ecosystem fragments because of plant species loss caused by nearby habitat destruction. The wide range for this estimate reflects substantial uncertainties in how many plant species will be lost, how much species loss will impact ecosystem functioning and whether plant species loss will decrease soil carbon. Our exploratory analysis suggests that biodiversity-dependent ecosystem service debts can be globally substantial, even when locally small, if they occur diffusely across vast areas of remaining ecosystems. There is substantial value in conserving not only the quantity (area), but also the quality (biodiversity) of natural ecosystems for the sustainable provision of ecosystem services.","[Isbell, Forest] Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Isbell, Forest; Tilman, David; Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Ctr Biodivers Theory & Modelling, Stn Ecol Expt, F-09200 Moulis, France","Isbell, F (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Plant Biol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",forest.isbell@gmail.com,"Isbell, Forest/C-6915-2012; Polasky, Stephen/AAC-5341-2019","Isbell, Forest/0000-0001-9689-769X; ",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [LTER 0620652]; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41],"We thank anonymous reviewers for suggestions that substantially improved this manuscript.

It can be produced from a wide variety of biomass feedstocks using different thermochemical conversion technologies with or without the recovery of energy coproducts, resulting in chars of differing quality and a range of overall system greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation outcomes. This analysis expands on previous sustainability studies by proposing a mechanistic life cycle GHG and economic operating cost assessment model for the coproduction of biochar and bioenergy from biomass residue feedstocks, with a case study for north-central Colorado presented. Production is modeled as a continuous function of temperature for slow pyrolysis, fast pyrolysis, and gasification systems. Biochar environmental benefits (C sequestration, N2O suppression, crop yield improvements) are predicted in terms of expected liming value and recalcitrance. System-level net GHG mitigation is computed, and net returns are estimated that reflect the variable economic costs of production, the agronomic value of biochar based on agricultural limestone or fertilizer displacement, and the value of GHG mitigation, with results compared to the alternate use of char for energy production. Case study results indicate that slow pyrolysis systems can mitigate up to 1.4 Mg CO2eq/Mg feedstock consumed, provided a favorable feedstock is utilized, production air pollutant emissions are mitigated, and energy coproducts are recovered. The model suggests that while financial returns are generally greater when char is consumed for energy (biocoal) than when used as a soil amendment (biochar), chars produced through high-temperature conversion processes will have greater GHG-mitigation value as biochar. The biochar scenario reaches economic parity at carbon prices as low as $50/Mg CO2eq for optimal scenarios, despite conservative modeling assumptions. This model is a step toward spatially explicit assessment and optimization of biochar system design across different feedstocks, conversion technologies, and agricultural soils.","[Field, John L.; Cotrufo, M.

Four regimes can occur, depending on the initial social cost of oil being larger or smaller than that of renewables and depending on the initial oil stock being large or small. We also offer some policy simulations for the first and second regime, which illustrate that with a lower discount rate more oil is left in situ and renewables are phased in more quickly. We identify the conditions under which the optimal carbon tax rises or decreases. Subsidizing renewables (without a carbon tax) induces more oil to be left in situ and a quicker phasing in of renewables, but oil is depleted more rapidly initially.

Internalization of climate damage lowers the private return to capital, and agents reduce investment in favor of mitigation and consumption.

Traditionally, proposed remedial approaches for a specific cleanup scenario are evaluated by overall project implementation cost, time frame of the cleanup, and effectiveness to meet cleanup goals. A new paradigm shift, referred to as sustainable remediation, has influenced the remediation industry to consider environmental, social, and economic impacts from cleanup activities. An environmental footprint analysis is the most common method to evaluate environmental implications of cleanup approaches. Presently, these footprint tools do not associate the environmental implications with global impacts. In this article, the method has been extended to integrate the social cost of carbon emissions to quantify global impacts. The case study site is a former aircraft parts manufacturing facility that caused chlorinated solvent contamination in soil and groundwater beneath the building. A groundwater pump-and-treat system was initially installed, followed by its gradual phase-out with concurrent phase in of in situ bioremediation. The case study evaluates the monetized societal benefits from quantifying carbon emission impacts of the proposed cleanup approaches and alternative scenarios. Our results suggest that societal impacts based on monetized carbon emissions can be reduced by 27% by optimizing the remediation processes. The sensitivity analysis results elucidate how variation in carbon prices and social discount rates can influence cleanup decisions for remediation projects.","[Harclerode, Melissa A.] CDM Smith, Edison, NJ USA; [Harclerode, Melissa A.] Montclair State Univ, Environm Management Program, Montclair, NJ USA; [Lal, Pankaj] Montclair State Univ, Earth & Environm Studies Dept, Montclair, NJ USA; [Miller, Michael E.] CDM Smith, Boston, MA USA","Harclerode, MA (corresponding author), 14 Magnolia Lane, Caldwell, NJ 07006 USA.",mel.harclerode@gmail.com,"Lal, Pankaj/J-7023-2019",,Montclair State University,Any errors or inaccuracies in this article are the sole responsibility of the authors.

Design Carbon footprint analysis. Data source Publicly available data on National Health Service Stop Smoking Services and per unit carbon emissions; published effectiveness data from the txt2stop trial and systematic reviews of smoking cessation services. Main outcome measures Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) per 1000 smokers, per lifetime quitter, and per quality-adjusted life year gained, and cost-effectiveness, including social cost of carbon, of smoking cessation services. Results Emissions per 1000 participants were 8143kg CO(2)e for text message support, 8619kg CO(2)e for telephone counselling, 16114kg CO(2)e for group counselling and 16372kg CO(2)e for individual counselling. Emissions per intervention lifetime quitter were 636 (95% CI 455 to 958) kg CO(2)e for text message support, 1051 (95% CI 560 to 2873) kg CO(2)e for telephone counselling, 1143 (95% CI 695 to 2270) kg CO(2)e for group counselling and 2823 (95% CI 1688 to 6549) kg CO(2)e for individual counselling. Text message, telephone and group counselling remained cost-effective when cost-effectiveness analysis was revised to include the environmental and economic cost of damage from carbon emissions. Conclusions All smoking cessation services had low emissions compared to the health gains produced. Text message support had the lowest emissions of the services evaluated. Smoking cessation services have small carbon footprints and were cost-effective after accounting for the societal costs of greenhouse gas emissions.","[Smith, Anna Jo Bodurtha] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA USA; [Tennison, Imogen] NHS Sustainable Dev Unit, East England Strateg Hlth Author, Cambridge, England; [Roberts, Ian; Free, Caroline] LSHTM, Dept Nutr & Publ Hlth Intervent Res, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Cairns, John] LSHTM, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1E 7HT, England","Free, C (corresponding author), LSHTM, Dept Nutr & Publ Hlth Intervent Res, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.",caroline.free@lshtm.ac.uk,"Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020","Smith, Anna Jo/0000-0002-7692-773X; Free, Caroline/0000-0003-1711-0006",MRCMedical Research Council UK (MRC); Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission,We thank the MRC for funding the txt2stop trial.

I measure the rate of aversion to inequality in consumption as expressed in the development aid given by rich countries to poor ones between 1965 and 2005. There is an ambiguous relationship between the pure rate of inequity aversion and the consumption rate, driven by the rate of risk aversion. However, for a reasonable choice of the rate of risk aversion, rich countries are shown to be inequity averse, and increasingly so over time. The social cost of carbon is very sensitive to equity weighting and assumptions about the rate of risk and inequity aversion. Estimates of the consumption rate of inequity aversion for recent data suggest that the equity-weighted social cost of carbon is less than 50% larger than the unweighted estimate.","[Tol, Richard S.

This paper develops a rapid assessment model for the SCC. The model includes the essential ingredients for calculating the SCC at the global scale and is designed to be transparent and easy to use and modify. Our goal is to provide a tool to help analysts and decision-makers quickly explore the implications of various modeling assumptions for the SCC. We use the model to conduct sensitivity analyses over some of the key input parameters, and we compare estimates of the SCC under certainty and uncertainty in a Monte Carlo analysis. We find that, due to the combined effects of uncertainty and risk aversion, the certainty-equivalent SCC can be substantially larger than the expected value of the SCC. In our Monte Carlo simulation, the certainty-equivalent SCC is more than four times larger than the expected value of the SCC, and we show that this result depends crucially on how the uncertain preference parameters are handled. We also compare the approximate present value of benefits estimated using the SCC to the exact value of compensating variation in the initial period for a wide range of hypothetical emission reduction policies.","[Newbold, Stephen C.; Griffiths, Charles; Moore, Chris; Wolverton, Ann; Kopits, Elizabeth] US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, EPA West Bldg-4316T,1301 Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA","Newbold, SC (corresponding author), US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, EPA West Bldg-4316T,1301 Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",newbold.steve@epa.gov,,,,,,129,16,16,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

One often overlooked source uncertainty are the forecasts of future baseline conditions (e.g., population, economic output, emissions) from which carbon mitigation benefits are assessed. Through, in some cases highly non-linear relationships, these baseline conditions determine the forecast level and rate of climate change, exposed populations, vulnerability, and way in which inter-temporal tradeoffs are valued. We study the impact of explicitly considering this uncertainty on a widely used metric to asses the benefits of carbon dioxide mitigation, the social cost of carbon (SCC). To explore this question, a detailed integrated assessment that couples economic and climate systems to assess the damages of climate change is driven by a library of consistent probabilistic socioeconomic-emission scenarios developed using a comprehensive global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We find that scenario uncertainty has a significant effect on estimates of the SCC and that excluding this source of uncertainty could lead to an underestimate of the mitigation benefits. A detailed decomposition finds that this effect is driven primarily through the role that uncertainty regarding future consumption per capita growth has on the value of inter-temporal tradeoffs through the consumption discount rate.","[Marten, Alex L.] US EPA, Washington, DC 20460 USA","Marten, AL (corresponding author), US EPA, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",marten.alex@epa.gov,,"Marten, Alex/0000-0003-3427-9719",,,,38,0,0,0,0,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

In this paper, I present a model of the PCF and integrate this feedback in the DICE Integrated Assessment Model to examine its consequences. I find that doing so increases the SCC by 10-20% in the baseline scenario, but that this impact is much more significant in the case of a damage function which is more reactive to very high temperature changes, and can reach up to 220%. It follows that setting industrial emission targets without taking into account this feedback would lead to excessive atmospheric carbon: I find that it increases the optimal emission control rate by circa 5% points on average over the period 2015-2110 and that this difference becomes much more significant when the constraint of limiting the increase in global mean temperature to +2 degrees C or +1. 5 degrees C is added to the model.","[Kessler, Louise] ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England; [Kessler, Louise] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kessler, Louise] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England","Kessler, L (corresponding author), ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England.; Kessler, L (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.; Kessler, L (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",l.kessler@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; UK Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC),"This Research was supported by the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, which is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council.",,58,3,3,1,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

SCCs are used to estimate the benefits of CO2 reductions from policies. However, little is known about the modeling underlying the values or the implied societal risks, making SCC estimates difficult to interpret and assess. This study performs the first in-depth examination of SCC modeling using controlled diagnostic experiments that yield detailed intermediate results, allow for direct comparison of individual components of the models, and facilitate evaluation of the individual model SCCs. Specifically, we analyze DICE, FUND, and PAGE and the multimodel approach used by the US Government. Through our component assessments, we trace SCC differences back to intermediate variables and specific features. We find significant variation in component-level behavior between models driven by model-specific structural and implementation elements, some resulting in artificial differences in results. These elements combine to produce model-specific tendencies in climate and damage responses that contribute to differences observed in SCC outcomes - producing PAGE SCC distributions with longer and fatter right tails and higher averages, followed by DICE with more compact distributions and lower averages, and FUND with distributions that include net benefits and the lowest averages. Overall, our analyses reveal fundamental model behavior relevant to many disciplines of climate research, and identify issues with the models, as well as the overall multimodel approach, that need further consideration. With the growing prominence of SCCs in decision-making, ranging from the local-level to international, improved transparency and technical understanding is essential for informed decisions.","[Rose, Steven K.; Diaz, Delavane B.; Blanford, Geoffrey J.] Elect Power Res Inst, Energy & Environm Anal Res Grp, 3412 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA","Rose, SK (corresponding author), Elect Power Res Inst, Energy & Environm Anal Res Grp, 3412 Hillview Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",srose@epri.com,,"Diaz, Delavane/0000-0001-8289-0980",,,,28,10,10,0,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

An important challenge has been to combine efficiency and equity considerations in a single social welfare framework. The Chichilnisky criterion is one way to resolve this. We consider its implementation in the climate-economy model Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE), and compare results for different damage functions, namely the standard one in DICE and the one proposed by Weitzman implying potential large climate damages at high temperature increases. We calculate optimal climate policy for different parameter settings and compare the results with those under the green golden rule (only final utility matters) and classical utilitarianism (no discounting). Optimal emission abatement trajectories turn out to be very different between standard discounted utilitarianism, classical utilitarianism and Chichilnisky specifications. The results are very sensitive to the damage function, the climate sensitivity parameter and especially the Chichilnisky weight given to utility of generations in the far future. We discuss conditions and reasons for preferring either classical utilitarianism or the Chichilnisky criterion, and conclude that a critical factor is the time horizon used in climate policy analysis. Adopting sustainable preferences as formalized by the Chichilnisky criterion in climate policy analysis has the advantage that the very long-term implications of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on the environment and human welfare are not downplayed.","[Botzen, W.

Based on a simple theoretical model, we give conditions under which the Aggregation Dilemma is expected to play a role in climate change cost-benefit analysis. We then study the importance of the Aggregation Dilemma with the integrated assessment model RICE [Nordhaus and Boyer, (2000) Warning the World: Economic Models of Global Warming. MA: MIT Press]. Aggregating all regions of the RICE-99 model into one region yields a 40% lower social cost of carbon than the RICE model itself predicts. Based on extrapolating the results, a country-level integrated assessment model would give a more than eight times higher social cost of carbon compared to a fully aggregated model. We suggest that these tentative results require researchers to rethink the aggregation level used in integrated assessment models and to develop models at much lower levels of aggregation than currently available.","[Schumacher, Ingmar] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France","Schumacher, I (corresponding author), IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",ingmar.schumacher@ipag.fr,,"Schumacher, Ingmar/0000-0003-2339-982X",,,,43,2,2,2,9,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Different methods have been used to estimate the impact of climate change on human welfare. Studies agree that there are positive and negative impacts. In the short term, positive impacts may dominate, but these are sunk benefits that will obtain regardless of abatement policy. In the longer term, there are net negative impacts. Poorer people tend to be more vulnerable to climate change. Estimated aggregate impacts are not very large, but they are uncertain and incomplete. Estimates of the marginal impacts suggest that greenhouse gas emissions should be taxed and that the emission reduction targets announced by politicians are probably too ambitious. Estimates of the willingness to pay for climate policy suggest that lay people are probably more concerned than experts about the total impact of climate change, whereas lay people and experts agree on estimates of the incremental impact of carbon dioxide emissions.","[Tol, Richard S.

However, if extraction becomes more costly as reserves are depleted, such policies also shorten the fossil fuel era, induce more fossil fuel to be left in the earth, and thus curb cumulative carbon emissions. These consequences are relevant, as global warming depends primarily on cumulative emissions. There is no green paradox for a specific carbon tax that rises at less than the market rate of interest. Because this is the case for the growth of the optimal carbon tax, the green paradox is a temporary second-best phenomenon. There is also a green paradox if there is a chance of a breakthrough in renewables technology occurring at some random future date. However, there will also be less investment in opening up fossil fuel deposits, and thus cumulative carbon emission will be curbed.","[van der Ploeg, Frederick] Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [van der Ploeg, Frederick] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","van der Ploeg, F (corresponding author), Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",rick.vanderploeg@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,42,12,12,0,21,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4705-5,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

Economic theory shows that RPSs are not first-best policy measures for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or solving other environmental problems. Nevertheless, they have been politically popular, in part because states hope they will help create new jobs in what the states expect will be a growth industry. Research suggests that RPSs are supported by Democratic legislatures in states with good solar and wind potential, are more likely in states with restructured electricity markets, and are less likely in states heavily dependent on natural gas for electricity generation. Research also suggests that RPSs have been successful at increasing renewable generation capacity, have increased the cost of electricity modestly where they have been implemented, and reduce carbon emissions at a cost roughly consistent with estimates of the social cost of carbon.","[Lyon, Thomas P.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Lyon, TP (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",tplyon@umich.edu,,,,,,46,4,4,1,6,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1340,,978-0-8243-4708-6,ANNU REV RESOUR ECON,Annu.

In reality, climate and energy systems contain tipping points, feedback loops, and exponential developments. This paper describes how to create realistic energy transition management models: quantitative models that can discover profitable pathways from fossil fuels to renewable energy. We review the literature regarding agent-based economics, disruptive innovation, and transition management and determine the following requirements. Actors must be detailed, heterogeneous, interacting, learning, and strategizing. Technology should be represented as a detailed and heterogeneous portfolio that can develop in a bottom-up manner, using endogenous feedback loops. Assumptions about discount rates and the social cost of carbon should be configurable. The model should contain interactions between the global, national, local, and individual level. A review of modelling techniques shows that equilibrium models are unsuitable and that system dynamics and discrete event simulation are too limited. The agent-based approach is found to be uniquely suited for the complex adaptive sociotechnical systems that must be modelled. But the choice for agent-based models does not mean a rejection of other approaches because they can be accommodated within the agent-based framework.

Synergies exist between diets low in GHGEs and health however some foods have the opposite relationship, such as sugar production being a relatively low source of GHGEs. In order to address this and to further characterise a healthy sustainable diet, we model the effect on UK non-communicable disease mortality and GHGEs of internalising the social cost of carbon into the price of food alongside a 20 % tax on sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs). Methods: Developing previously published work, we simulate four tax scenarios: (A) a GHGEs tax of 2.86 pound/tonne of CO2 equivalents (tCO2e)/100 g product on all products with emissions greater than the mean across all food groups (0.36 kgCO2e/100 g); (B) scenario A but with subsidies on foods with emissions lower than 0.36 kgCO2e/100 g such that the effect is revenue neutral; (C) scenario A but with a 20 % sales tax on SSBs; (D) scenario B but with a 20 % sales tax on SSBs. An almost ideal demand system is used to estimate price elasticities and a comparative risk assessment model is used to estimate changes to non-communicable disease mortality. Results: We estimate that scenario A would lead to 300 deaths delayed or averted, 18,900 ktCO2e fewer GHGEs, and 3.0 pound billion tax revenue; scenario B, 90 deaths delayed or averted and 17,100 ktCO2e fewer GHGEs; scenario C, 1,200 deaths delayed or averted, 18,500 ktCO2e fewer GHGEs, and 3.4 pound billion revenue; and scenario D, 2,000 deaths delayed or averted and 16,500 ktCO2e fewer GHGEs. Deaths averted are mainly due to increased fibre and reduced fat consumption; a SSB tax reduces SSB and sugar consumption. Conclusions: Incorporating the social cost of carbon into the price of food has the potential to improve health, reduce GHGEs, and raise revenue. The simple addition of a tax on SSBs can mitigate negative health consequences arising from sugar being low in GHGEs. Further conflicts remain, including increased consumption of unhealthy foods such as cakes and nutrients such as salt.","[Briggs, Adam D.

These models have crucial flaws that make them close to useless as tools for policy analysis: certain inputs (e. g., the discount rate) are arbitrary, but have huge effects on the SCC estimates the models produce; the models' descriptions of the impact of climate change are completely ad hoc, with no theoretical or empirical foundation; and the models can tell us nothing about the most important driver of the SCC, the possibility of a catastrophic climate outcome.

Such underlying rates can vary enormously, from. approximate to 1 percent for idiosyncratic diversifiable risk to. approximate to 7 percent for systematic nondiversifiable risk. Which risk-adjusted rate is chosen can have a huge impact on cost-benefit analysis. In this expository paper, I attempt to set forth in accessible language with a simple linear model what I think are some of the basic issues involved in discounting climate risks. The paper introduces a new concept that may be relevant for climate-change discounting: the degree to which an investment hedges against the bad tail of catastrophic damages by insuring positive expected payoffs even under the worst circumstances. The prototype application is calculating the social cost of carbon.","Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Weitzman, ML (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mweitzman@harvard.edu,,,,,,13,53,54,0,25,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Only 14 estimates of the total damage cost of climate change have been published, a research effort that is in sharp contrast to the urgency of the public debate and the proposed expenditure on greenhouse gas emission reduction. These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is $50/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100. From a welfare perspective, the impact of climate change is problematic because population is endogenous, and because policy analyses should separate impatience, risk aversion, and inequity aversion between and within countries.","[Tol, Richard S.

The relation is captured by climate sensitivity, which measures the response to a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations compared to pre-industrial levels. Estimates of climate sensitivity play a crucial role in evaluating the impacts of climate change and constitute one of the most important inputs into the computation of the social cost of carbon, which reflects the socially optimal value of a carbon tax. Climate sensitivity has been estimated by many researchers, but their results vary significantly. We collect 48 estimates from 16 studies and analyze the literature quantitatively. We find evidence for publication selection bias: researchers tend to report preferentially large estimates of climate sensitivity.

Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics-and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting.","[Caro, Felipe; Corbett, Charles J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Tan, Tarkan] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Sch Ind Engn, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Zuidwijk, Rob] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands","Caro, F (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",fcaro@anderson.ucla.edu; charles.corbett@anderson.ucla.edu; t.tan@tue.nl; rzuidwijk@rsm.nl,"corbett, charles j/B-2454-2008; Zuidwijk, Rob/AAG-5011-2020","corbett, charles j/0000-0003-1814-3977; Zuidwijk, Rob/0000-0002-1493-3974",,,,58,45,47,4,94,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1523-4614,1526-5498,,M&SOM-MANUF SERV OP,M&SOM-Manuf.

Alternative land cover choices indicate tradeoffs among the value of ecosystem services created and the economic returns. These tradeoffs are explored using efficiency frontiers that determine the least value in ecosystem services that must be given up to generate additional economic returns. Agricultural producers may switch to irrigation with surface water using on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery systems in response to groundwater overdraft, and this has consequences for the bundle of ecosystem service values and economic returns achievable from the landscape. Planning that accounts for both ecosystem service value and economic returns can achieve more value for society, as does the adoption of reservoirs though lowering the costs of irrigation, increasing groundwater levels, and reducing fuel combustion and associated GHG emissions from groundwater pumping. Sensitivity analyses of per unit value of ecosystem services, crop prices, and the groundwater and water purification model parameters indicate tradeoff among ecosystems service values, such as the use of a high-end social cost of carbon ultimately lowers groundwater supply and water purification value by more than 15%.","[Kovacs, Kent; West, Grant] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Kovacs, K (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",kkovacs@uark.edu,,"West, Grant/0000-0002-0066-8903","University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture; US Geologic Survey of the 104b research grant program, US Department of the Interior","This project was supported by the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture and the US Geologic Survey of the 104b research grant program, US Department of the Interior.

However, this mega project will have an impact on Jakarta's economy (gross domestic regional product, GDRP) and the CO2 emissions will have an effect as a result of the social cost of carbon because the coal-fired power plant has the highest emission rate compared with other power-plant types. Through the system-dynamics (SD) approach, this study aimed to examine several alternative policy scenarios and determine the best options that can be applied by the Jakarta government to ensure the success of electricity production, which can help to grow Jakarta's economy and minimize the effects of CO2 emissions simultaneously. Three policies were simulated in the model: business as usual (BAU), a green policy, and a good economic policy. The results of simulation show that each scenario has its own advantages and disadvantages to achieve government target. This study reveals that using combination of green and economic policy is highly recommended to help Jakarta's growth sustainably.","[Destyanto, Arry Rahmawan; Hidayatno, Akhmad; Amalia, Adinda] Univ Indonesia, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Syst Engn Modeling & Simulat Lab, Kampus UI Depok, Depok 16424, Indonesia","Hidayatno, A (corresponding author), Univ Indonesia, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Syst Engn Modeling & Simulat Lab, Kampus UI Depok, Depok 16424, Indonesia.",akhmad@eng.ui.ac.id,"Hidayatno, Akhmad/AAI-1934-2020","Hidayatno, Akhmad/0000-0002-3837-8039; Rahmawan Destyanto, Arry/0000-0001-8080-3556",,,,30,0,0,0,9,UNIV INDONESIA,DEPOK,"DIRECTORATE RESEARCH & PUBLIC SERV, UI CAMPUS, KAMOUS UNIV INDONESIA, DEPOK, 16424, INDONESIA",2086-9614,2087-2100,,INT J TECHNOL,Int.

Two different but related major application types are addressed. First there are global-scale analyses that focus on calculating optimal global carbon emissions trajectories and carbon prices that maximize global welfare. The second application is the use of the same tools to compute the social cost of carbon (SCC) for use in US regulatory processes. The SCC is defined as the climate damages attributable to an increase of one metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions above a baseline emissions trajectory that assumes no new climate policies. The paper describes the three main quantitative models that have been used in the optimal carbon policy and SCC calculations and then summarizes the range of results that have been produced using them. The results span an extremely broad range (up to an order of magnitude) across modeling platforms as well as across the plausible ranges of input assumptions to a single model. This broad range of results sets the stage for a discussion of the five key challenges that face BCA practitioners participating in the national and global climate change policy analysis arenas: (1) including the possibility of catastrophic outcomes; (2) factoring in equity and income distribution considerations; (3) addressing intertemporal discounting and intergenerational equity; (4) projecting baseline demographics, technological change, and policies inside and outside the energy sector; and (5) characterizing the full set of uncertainties to be dealt with and designing a decision-making process that updates and adapts new scientific and economic information into that process in a timely and productive manner. The paper closes by describing how the BCA models have been useful in climate policy discussions to date despite the uncertainties that pervade the results that have been produced.","[Weyant, John] Stanford Univ, Huang Engn Ctr, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Room 260, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Weyant, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Huang Engn Ctr, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Room 260, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",weyant@stanford.edu,,,,,,85,18,18,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2194-5888,2152-2812,,J BENEFIT-COST ANAL,J.

Recently an approach combining OBA with a consumption tax has been proposed to mitigate carbon leakage. This paper evaluates the potential outcome in a game of climate policies, by examining the Nash equilibrium outcome of a non-cooperative policy instrument game between regions that regulate their emissions separately. We construct a computable general equilibrium model and investigate the case when regions can choose to supplement their ETS with OBA and/or with a consumption tax, in the presence of another regulating region. In the context of the EU and China, we show how regional interests combined with a national climate target, may lead to different climate policy combinations.","[Kaushal, Kevin R.] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway; [Kaushal, Kevin R.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway","Kaushal, KR (corresponding author), Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway.; Kaushal, KR (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway.",kevin.kaushal@ssb.no,,,,,,39,0,0,1,1,NOW PUBLISHERS INC,HANOVER,"PO BOX 1024, HANOVER, MA 02339 USA",1944-012X,1944-0138,,STRATEG BEHAV ENVIRO,Strateg.

The methodology is based on various critical period approaches (the critical period method). A multicriteria analysis was carried out to evaluate the effects of the critical period duration on the system characteristics. It was found that the critical period length is a design variable that significantly affects the economic, environmental and social aspects of the solution, with a lengthening of the critical period resulting in improvement of the overall sustainability of the solution. The results obtained indicate that a solar PV system is a promising solution to the energy sustainability of UWSSs. This form of energy supply does not emit greenhouse gases and furthermore the 'social cost' of carbon dioxide estimates decrease. The concept of a stand-alone PV energy system is a particularly promising sustainable energy solution.","[Margeta, Jure] Univ Split, Fac Civil Engn Architecture & Geodesy, Water Resources & Environm Management Dept, Split, Croatia; [Durin, Bojan] Univ Zagreb, Fac Geotech Engn, Dept Hydrotech, Varazhdin, Croatia","Durin, B (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Geotech Engn, Dept Hydrotech, Varazhdin, Croatia.",bojan.djurin@gfv.hr,"Durin, Bojan/W-1782-2017","Durin, Bojan/0000-0002-2361-8036",,,,25,1,1,0,13,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1741-7589,,,P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M,Proc.

The results suggest a policy trade-off to some extent between mitigating population ageing and mitigating climate change. The lower fertility scenario, which implies an older future population, results in lower carbon emissions and therefore a lower optimal carbon price.

Although there are potential efficiency gains from its application, we argue that the SCC may be inappropriate for use in CBA for three reasons. First, as currently calculated, the SCC typically excludes the potential for catastrophes and certain types of climate damages, and assumes perfect substitutability between natural and human capital. For these reasons, it is likely to be biased downwards, and as such would provide misleading advice to policy-makers. Second, the SCC is a global measure of benefits, whereas standard practice in CBA is to include only domestic costs and benefits. Accounting for costs borne outside of Canada and along only one dimension (carbon damage) risks reducing economic efficiency and confusing the users of CBA studies. Third, SCC-based decision-making is unlikely to be consistent with Canadian commitments to international partners on emissions reductions; so its adoption risks institutionalizing non-delivery of those commitments.","[Heyes, Anthony; Morgan, Dylan] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Heyes, A (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,26,2,2,0,9,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We provide information to assess trade-offs associated with the management of seagrass beds, which provide a number of ecosystem services, but are presently impacted by many stressors. We develop an interdisciplinary framework for valuing multiple ecosystem services and apply it to the case of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a dominant seagrass species in the northern hemisphere. We identify and quantify links between three eelgrass functions (habitat for fish, carbon, and nitrogen uptake) and economic goods in Sweden, quantify these using ecological endpoints, estimate the marginal average value of the impact of losing one hectare of eelgrass along the Swedish northwest coast on welfare in monetary terms, and aggregate these values while considering double-counting. Over a 20-50 year period we find that compared to unvegetated habitats, a hectare of eelgrass, including the organic material accumulated in the sediment, produces an additional 626 kg cod fishes and 7535 wrasse individuals and sequesters 98.6 ton carbon and 466 kg nitrogen. We value the flow of future benefits associated with commercial fishing, avoided climate change damages, and reduced eutrophication at 170,000 SEK in 2014 (20,700 US$) or 11,000 SEK (1300 US$) annualized at 4%. Fish production, which is the most commonly valued ecosystem service in the seagrass literature, only represented 25% of the total value whereas a conservative estimate of nitrogen regulation constituted 46%, suggesting that most seagrass beds are undervalued. Comparing these values with historic losses of eelgrass we show that the Swedish northwest coast has suffered a substantial reduction in fish production and mineral regulation. Future work should improve the understanding of the geographic scale of eelgrass functions, how local variables affect the value of these functions, and how to defensibly aggregate a multitude of economic values.","[Cole, Scott G.] EnviroEcon Sweden Consultancy, Froson, Sweden; [Moksnes, Per-Olav] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden","Cole, SG (corresponding author), EnviroEcon Sweden Consultancy, Froson, Sweden.",scott@eesweden.com,,,Swedish Research Council FORMASSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [212-2011-758]; Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management [2283-14],"This research was funded by grants from the Swedish Research Council FORMAS (contract no. 212-2011-758) and the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (contract no. 2283-14) to PM and L.

The ability to store carbon has an economic value, but such estimates are not common for ocean environments, and not yet estimated for the Arctic Ocean. With the severe climatic changes in the Arctic Ocean, impacting sea ice and potentially the vertical carbon transport mechanisms, a projection of future changes in Arctic Ocean carbon storage is also of interest. In order to value present and evolving carbon storage in the changing Arctic marine environment we combine an ocean model with an economic analysis. Placing a value on these changes helps articulate the importance of the carbon storage service to society. The standing stock and fluxes of organic and inorganic carbon from the atmosphere, rivers, shelves and through the gateways linking to lower latitudes, and to the deep of the Arctic Ocean are investigated using the physically chemically biologically coupled SINMOD model. To obtain indications of the effect of climate change, trajectories of two IPCC climate scenarios RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 from the Max Planck Institute were used for the period 2006-2099. The results show an increase in the net carbon storage in the Arctic Ocean in this time period to be 1.0 and 2.3% in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Most of this increase is caused by an increased atmospheric CO2 uptake until 2070. The continued increase in inorganic carbon storage between 2070 and 2099 results from increased horizontal influx from lower latitude marine regions. First estimates of carbon storage values in the Arctic Ocean are calculated using the social cost of carbon (SCC) and carbon market values as two outer bounds from 2019 to 2099, based on the simulated scenarios. We find the Arctic Ocean will over the time period studied increase its storage of carbon to a value of between (sic)27.6 billion and (sic)1 trillion. This paper clearly neglects a multitude of different negative consequences of climate change in the Arctic, but points to the fact that there are also some positive counterbalancing effects.","[Armstrong, Claire W.; Foley, Naomi S.] Univ Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Tromso, Norway; [Slagstad, Dag; Ellingsen, Ingrid] SINTEF Ocean, Trondheim, Norway; [Chierici, Melissa] Inst Marine Res, Fram Ctr, Tromso, Norway; [Reigstad, Marit] Univ Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Arctic & Marine Biol, Tromso, Norway","Armstrong, CW (corresponding author), Univ Tromso, Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fishery Sci, Tromso, Norway.",claire.armstrong@uit.no,"Reigstad, Marit/B-2497-2013","Reigstad, Marit/0000-0002-8592-7192","Norwegian Research Council projects CARBON BRIDGE, a Polar Programme - Norwegian Research Council [226415]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [678760]","This study was supported by the Norwegian Research Council projects CARBON BRIDGE, a Polar Programme (Project No. 226415) funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

The evaluation method used is as follows. First, a technical efficiency measurement method that is capable of considering both desirable outputs and undesirable outputs is used to measure the technical efficiency of the carbon reduction efforts and identify the benchmark firms with the best technical efficiency. Next, an attempt is made to estimate the greenhouse gas reduction that is realized by the sample if their carbon reduction efforts are accompanied by the implementation of a benchmarking system. Finally, the monetary value of the greenhouse gas reduction is estimated so as to develop a better understanding of the carbon reduction benefits for the adoption of the process outlined above.

Atmospheric deposition of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) are abiotic flows (wet, dry, and total) from the atmosphere to land surfaces, which potentially can become available to sequester carbon (C) as soil inorganic carbon (SIC). However, these processes typically have not been included in economic valuations of ecosystem services. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate an approach for valuing non-constrained potential SIC sequestration from atmospheric Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition based on the concept of the avoided social cost of carbon dioxide emissions (SC-CO2). Maximum monetary values associated with the non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were compiled for the contiguous United States (U.S.) by soil order, land resource region (LRR), state, and region using available deposition data from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NRSP-3). For the entire contiguous U.S., an average annual monetary value for the non-constrained potential SIC sequestration due to atmospheric Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition was $135M (i.e., $135 million U.S. dollars, where M = million = 10(6)). Mollisols, Alfisols, and Entisols were soil orders with the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration. When normalized by land area, however, Vertisols had the highest average annual monetary values followed by Alfisols and Mollisols for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration. From a more agricultural perspective, the LRRs with the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were the Western Range and Irrigated Region (D), the Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region (M), and the Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region (H). When normalized by area, the LRRS with the highest average annual monetary values were the Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region (I) and the Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop and Range Region (U). Among the U.S. states, the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico, but when normalized by area the highest values by state were Kansas, Iowa, and Texas. Geographical regions in the contiguous U.S. with the highest average annual monetary values for non-constrained potential SIC sequestration were the South Central, Midwest, and West; when normalized by area, the highest values by region were South Central, Midwest, and Northern Plains. Constraints on maximum monetary values, based on physical, chemical, biological, economic, social, and political limitations, need to be considered and quantified to obtain more precise and accurate accounting of the ES associated with SIC sequestration due to atmospheric Ca2+ and Mg2+ deposition.","[Mikhailova, Elena A.; Zurqani, Hamdi A.; Post, Christopher J.] Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Zurqani, Hamdi A.] Univ Tripoli, Dept Soil & Water Sci, Tripoli 13538, Libya; [Schlautman, Mark A.] Clemson Univ, Dept Environm Engn & Earth Sci, Anderson, SC 29625 USA","Mikhailova, EA (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",eleanam@clemson.edu; h.zurqani@gmail.com; cpost@clemson.edu; mschlau@clemson.edu,"ZURQANI, Hamdi A./G-5433-2016","ZURQANI, Hamdi A./0000-0002-9250-4534; Schlautman, Mark/0000-0001-6522-4345",,,,24,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,MAY,2020,10,5,,,,,,,200,10.3390/geosciences10050200,,,13,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Geology,LZ8KX,WOS:000541470700027,,DOAJ Gold,,,9/30/2020

Burdened low-income communities and people of color could experience health benefits from reductions in air and water pollution, yet these same groups could suffer harm if transitions lack broad public input or if policies prioritize elite or corporate interests. This paper highlights how U.S. energy transitions build from, and contribute to, environmental injustices. Energy justice requires not only ending disproportionate harm, it also entails involvement in the design of solutions and fair distribution of benefits, such as green jobs and clean air. To what extent does the confluence of state, civic, and market processes assure just transitions to clean, low-carbon energy production involving equitable distribution of costs, benefits, and decision-making power? To explore this question we assess trends with (1) fossil fuel divestment; (2) carbon taxes and social cost of carbon measurements; (3) cap-and-trade; (4) renewable energy; and (5) energy efficiency. Current research demonstrates opportunities and pitfalls in each area with mixed or partial energy justice consequences, leading to our call for greater attention to the specifics of distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice in research, policy, and action. Illustrative energy transition case studies suggest the feasibility and benefit of empowering approaches, but also indicate there can be conflict between green and just, as evident though stark inequities in clean energy initiatives. To identify positive pathways forward, we compile priorities for an energy justice research agenda based on interactive and participatory practices aligning advocacy, activism, and academics.","[Finley-Brook, Mary] Univ Richmond, Dept Geog & Environm, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Holloman, Erica L.] Southeast CARE Coalit, Newport News, VA 23607 USA","Finley-Brook, M (corresponding author), Univ Richmond, Dept Geog & Environm, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",mbrook@richmond.edu; holloman.e.l@gmail.com,,"Finley-Brook, Mary/0000-0001-6416-3560",University of Richmond; Bonner Center for Civic Engagement,"Mary Finley-Brook appreciates travel funding from the University of Richmond, support from the Bonner Center for Civic Engagement, and insights from Zoltan Grossman, Abigail Martin, Noel Healy, Curt Gurvich, Valerie Rountree, Reverend Lennox Yearwood, Jr., and Munro Brook.

By definition, the SC-CO2 is a measure, in dollars, of the long-term damage resulting from the emission of a metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, this dollar figure also represents the value of damages avoided due to an equivalent reduction or sequestration of CO2. The objective of this study was to assess the value of SIC stocks in the contiguous United States (U.S.) by soil order, soil depth (0-20, 20-100, 100-200 cm), land resource region (LRR), state, and region using information from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database together with a reported SC-CO2 of $42 (U.S. dollars). With this approach, the calculated monetary value for total SIC storage in the contiguous U.S. was between $3.48T (i.e., $3.48 trillion U.S. dollars, where T = trillion = 10(12)) and $14.4T, with a midpoint value of $8.34T. Soil orders with the highest (midpoint) values for SIC storage were: 1) Mollisols ($3.57T), 2) Aridisols ($1.99T), and 3) Alfisols ($841B) (i.e., $841B is 841 billion U.S. dollars, where B = billion = 10(9)).

Through the 8-month project duration, 1432 bulbs were exchanged at 23 events reaching 181 households in low-income areas that, through a year of use, were estimated to save residents approximately $18,219 in electricity bills, reducing CO2 emissions from power plants by 122 metric tons. Since this pilot reached less than 1% of households, we extrapolated a reach of 2%, 5%, and 7.5%, and found substantial potential decreases in power plant emissions and financial savings.

This formula, which holds under quite plausible assumptions, reveals that the damage is proportional to current GDP, with the proportion depending only on three factors: (i) discounting, (ii) the expected damage elasticity (how many percent of the output flow is lost from an extra unit of carbon in the atmosphere), and (iii) the structure of carbon depreciation in the atmosphere. Thus, the stochastic values of future output, consumption, and the atmospheric CO2 concentration, as well as the paths of technology (whether endogenous or exogenous) and population, and so on, all disappear from the formula. We find that the optimal tax should be a bit higher than the median, or most well-known, estimates in the literature. We also formulate a parsimonious yet comprehensive and easily solved model allowing us to compute the optimal and market paths for the use of different sources of energy and the corresponding climate change. We find coalrather than oilto be the main threat to economic welfare, largely due to its abundance. We also find that the costs of inaction are particularly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the substitutability of different energy sources and technological progress.","[Golosov, Mikhail] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Hassler, John; Krusell, Per] Stockholm Univ, IIES, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Tsyvinski, Aleh] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Golosov, M (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, 111 Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",golosov@princeton.edu; john@hassler.se; per.krusell@iies.su.se; a.tsyvinski@yale.edu,,,,,,71,193,192,10,116,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,JAN,2014,82,1,,,,,41,88,,10.3982/ECTA10217,,,48,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AA7KQ,WOS:000331276700002,,Green Published,Y,N,9/30/2020

Such models are currently used to derive the benefits of carbon mitigation policies through estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC). To remain tractable these models often utilize highly simplified representations of complex natural, social, and economic systems. The authors consider three prominent IAMs, DICE, FUND, and PAGE, and compare their highly simplified temperature response models to two upwelling diffusion energy balance models that better reflect the progressive heat uptake of the deep ocean. They find that all three IAMs fail to fully capture important characteristics in the dynamics of temperature response, especially for high equilibrium climate sensitivities. This has serious implications given these models are often run with distributions for the equilibrium climate sensitivity which have a positive probability for such states of the world. The authors find that, all else equal, the temperature response model in FUND can lead to estimates of the expected SCC that are 10-75% lower than those derived using more realistic climate models, while the models in DICE and PAGE lead to expected SCC estimates that are 10-110% and 40-260% higher, respectively.","US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA","Marten, AL (corresponding author), US EPA, Natl Ctr Environm Econ, Washington, DC 20460 USA.",marten.alex@epa.gov,,"Marten, Alex/0000-0003-3427-9719",,,,42,4,4,2,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,20-Oct,2011,5,,,,,,,,201118,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-18,,,43,Economics,Business & Economics,865CD,WOS:000298287500001,,DOAJ Gold,,,9/30/2020

This argument suggests that the appropriate probability distributions for these factors may be fat-tailed. The matter of tail shape has important implications for the calculation of the social cost of carbon dioxide (SCCO2). In this paper a probabilistic integrated assessment model is adapted to allow for the possibility of a thin, intermediate or fat tail for both (i) the climate sensitivity parameter and (ii) the damage function exponent. Results show that depending on the tail shape of the climate sensitivity parameter the mean SCCO2 rises by 29-85%. Changes in the mean SCCO2 due to the adjustments to the damage function alone range from a reduction of 7% to a rise of 12%. The combination of both leads to rises of 33-15%. Greater rises occur for the upper percentiles of the SCCO2 estimates. Given the uncertainties in both the science and the economics of climate change different tail shapes deserve consideration due to their important implications for the range of possible values for the SCCO2.","[Pycroft, J.] European Commiss, IPTS, JRC, Econ Climate Change Energy & Transport Unit, Seville 41092, Spain; [Hope, C.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England","Pycroft, J (corresponding author), European Commiss, IPTS, JRC, Econ Climate Change Energy & Transport Unit, Edificio EXPO,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",Jonathan.PYCROFT@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,39,12,12,0,13,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,22-Dec,2011,5,,,,,,,,201122,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2011-22,,,30,Economics,Business & Economics,865YM,WOS:000298346800001,,DOAJ Gold,,,9/30/2020

That calculation, however, omits many of the biggest risks associated with climate change, and downplays the impact of current emissions on future generations. Our reanalysis explores the effects of uncertainty about climate sensitivity, the shape of the damage function, and the discount rate. We show that the social cost of carbon is uncertain across a broad range, and could be much higher than $21/tCO(2). In our case combining high climate sensitivity, high damages, and a low discount rate, the social cost of carbon could be almost $900/tCO(2) in 2010, rising to $1,500/tCO(2) in 2050. The most ambitious scenarios for eliminating carbon dioxide emissions as rapidly as technologically feasible (reaching zero or negative net global emissions by the end of this century) require spending up to $150 to $500 per ton of reductions of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Using a reasonable set of alternative assumptions, therefore, the damages from a ton of carbon dioxide emissions in 2050 could exceed the cost of reducing emissions at the maximum technically feasible rate. Once this is the case, the exact value of the social cost of carbon loses importance: the clear policy prescription is to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible, and cost-effectiveness analysis offers better insights for climate policy than cost-benefit analysis.","[Ackerman, Frank; Stanton, Elizabeth A.] US Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, Somerville, MA 02144 USA","Ackerman, F (corresponding author), US Ctr, Stockholm Environm Inst, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA.",frank.ackerman@sei-us.org,,"Ackerman, Frank/0000-0002-7940-482X",,,,28,103,103,1,25,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,4-Apr,2012,6,,,,,,,,201210,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-10,,,26,Economics,Business & Economics,928BS,WOS:000302955200001,,DOAJ Gold,,,9/30/2020

They find that SCC estimates are highly sensitive to uncertainty in extrapolating damages to high temperatures at moderate-to-high levels of risk aversion, but only modestly so at low levels of risk aversion. While in the absence of risk aversion, all of the SCC estimates but one agree within a factor of two, with a moderate level of risk aversion included, the differences among estimates grow greatly. For example, one composite damage specification, combining elements of different literature-derived specifications and roughly taking into account calibration uncertainty, yields SCC values 32% higher than the standard quadratic DICE damage function in the absence of risk aversion. With a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 1.4, however, the same uncertain specification yields SCC values almost triple those of the standard function. The authors conclude that failure to consider damages uncertainty and risk aversion jointly can lead to significant underestimation of the SCC.","[Kopp, Robert E.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA","Kopp, RE (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",robert.kopp@rutgers.edu,"Golub, Alexander/E-8224-2019","Golub, Alexander/0000-0002-3586-1447; Kopp, Robert/0000-0003-4016-9428",,,,45,28,29,0,15,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,30-Apr,2012,6,,,,,,,,201213,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-13,,,41,Economics,Business & Economics,934YJ,WOS:000303482500001,,DOAJ Gold,,,9/30/2020

They also estimate the global damage potential for each gas-the ratio of the social cost of the non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas to the social cost of carbon dioxide. For all gases, they find the social costs and damage potentials sensitive to alternative assumptions. The global damage potentials are compared to global warming potentials (GWPs), a key metric used to compare gases. The authors find that global damage potentials are higher than GWPs in nearly all sensitivities. This finding suggests that previous papers using GWPs may be underestimating the relative importance of reducing non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions from a climate damage perspective. Of particular interest is the sensitivity of results to carbon dioxide fertilization, which notably reduces the social cost of carbon dioxide, but only has a small effect on the other gases.

Here we adapt the simple model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) to explicitly represent the state dependence of the CO2 airborne fraction. Our adapted model (FAIR) reproduces the range of behaviour shown in full and intermediate complexity ESMs under several idealised carbon pulse and exponential concentration increase experiments.

Results indicate that, if co-firing is recognized as a renewable, coal may crowd-out traditional renewables with increased generation and additional investments. Regarding CO2 emissions, we find surges when co-firing is recognized as a renewable. The rise is more significant in Germany due to greater coal capacity. In France, the magnitude depends on the share of nuclear with a lower increase when old nuclear plants are prolonged. Finally, we find that recognizing co-firing as a renewable reduces the overall costs for electricity. We balance the cost saving with the increased social cost from higher CO2 emissions. Results show that the cost saving is lower than the increased carbon cost for society with carbon valuation around 100 Euros/tCO(2), except in France when old nuclear plants are not decommissioned.","[Bertrand, Vincent] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Bertrand, Vincent] Univ Paris 09, Climate Econ Chair, Paris, France","Bertrand, V (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.; Bertrand, V (corresponding author), Univ Paris 09, Climate Econ Chair, Paris, France.",vincent.bertrand@univ-fcomte.fr,,,Climate Economics Chair,"This work is part of the Agriculture and Forestry research program by the Climate Economics Chair, Paris-Dauphine University.

One of the concerns is that the drainage required for cultivating oil palm in peatlands leads to soil subsidence, potentially increasing future flood risks. This study analyzes the hydrological and economic effects of oil palm production in a peat landscape in Central Kalimantan. We examine two land use scenarios, one involving conversion of the complete landscape including a large peat area to oil palm plantations, and another involving mixed land use including oil palm plantations, jelutung ( jungle rubber; (Dyera spp.) plantations, and natural forest. The hydrological effect was analyzed through flood risk modeling using a high-resolution digital elevation model. For the economic analysis, we analyzed four ecosystem services: oil palm production, jelutung production, carbon sequestration, and orangutan habitat. This study shows that after 100 years, in the oil palm scenario, about 67% of peat in the study area will be subject to regular flooding. The flood-prone area will be unsuitable for oil palm and other crops requiring drained soils. The oil palm scenario is the most profitable only in the short term and when the externalities of oil palm production, i.e., the costs of CO2 emissions, are not considered. In the examined scenarios, the social costs of carbon emissions exceed the private benefits from oil palm plantations in peat. Depending upon the local hydrology, income from jelutung, which can sustainably be grown in undrained conditions and does not lead to soil subsidence, outweighs that from oil palm after several decades. These findings illustrate the trade-offs faced at present in Indonesian peatland management and point to economic advantages of an approach that involves expansion of oil palm on mineral lands while conserving natural peat forests and using degraded peat for crops that do not require drainage.","[Sumarga, Elham] Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Bandung, Indonesia; [Hein, Lars] Wageningen Univ, Environm Syst Anal Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hooijer, Aljosja; Vernimmen, Ronald] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands","Sumarga, E (corresponding author), Inst Teknol Bandung, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Bandung, Indonesia.",,,"Vernimmen, Ronald/0000-0002-9899-3826; Sumarga, Elham/0000-0002-8581-8535",European Research Council through the ECOSPACE project [263027],We thankfully acknowledge the financial support of the European Research Council (Grant Agreement No. 263027) through the ECOSPACE project.

However, there has been little analysis of the extent to which CFs can help achieve REDD+ objectives in Cameroon. We explore options for REDD+ within CFs, as well as challenges and possible ways forward. Cocoa agroforestry in deforested or highly degraded CFs is currently the most competitive option for implementing REDD+ while delivering ecological, economic, and social cobenefits. Reduced-impact logging and conservation or natural regeneration are technically sound options for emissions reductions within CFs, but are unlikely to compete with other more profitable activities at the current low carbon market prices of approximately USD $5/tonne of carbon. However, these options could potentially compete under a social cost of carbon estimated at $43/tonne of carbon. The current CF architecture presents a set of factors that could favor REDD+ implementation, including: good legal and institutional frameworks and practices compatible with REDD+ safeguards, experience and knowledge in related payments for ecosystem services and performance-based finance pilots, and social capital in a community of practice. The CF architecture also features potentially inhibiting factors such as poor governance (notably, elite capture and corruption), unclear carbon rights, and financing challenges. We identify a set of enabling actions for delivery of REDD+ within CFs in Cameroon, which include: clarifying carbon rights; establishing a benefit-sharing mechanism from the national to the local level with clear rules for rewarding emission reductions in CFs; and building monitoring, reporting, and verification infrastructure for REDD+ within CFs. More importantly, adopting an integrated approach in which CFs serve multiple objectives, including ecosystem-based adaptation, REDD+, and the original community forestry objectives could enable drawing from both adaptation and mitigation finance, technical support, and provide long-term sustainable development benefits.","[Bernard, Florence; Minang, Peter A.] World Agroforestry Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya; [Bernard, Florence; Minang, Peter A.] ASB Partnership Trop Forest Margins, Nairobi, Kenya","Bernard, F (corresponding author), World Agroforestry Ctr, Nairobi, Kenya.; Bernard, F (corresponding author), ASB Partnership Trop Forest Margins, Nairobi, Kenya.",,,,"Department for International Development through the DRYAD project, Financing sustainable community forest enterprises in Cameroon","We acknowledge the financial support of the Department for International Development through the DRYAD project, Financing sustainable community forest enterprises in Cameroon, which supported the development of this paper.",,73,1,1,3,7,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,,,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

There are different types of weights or 'values' that can be assigned to soil carbon. One approach is to assign monetary weights to such resources using economic valuation models. The total set of such monetized weights is referred to as total economic value (TEV). The different components of the value of soil carbon differ both conceptually and with respect to how they can be measured or manifested. There are various methods for quantifying soil carbon values that differ with respect to the types of values they are suitable or able to assess. This chapter reviews the various valuation approaches that can be applied to estimate different components of the TEV of soil carbon. In this respect, it discusses how soil carbon values can be estimated through both stated and reveal preferences methods, and places particular emphasis on the production function approach. In addition other approaches are presented, including the preventive or mitigation expenditure (marginal abatement costs) approach and the social cost of carbon approach. Lastly, the chapter addresses the question of how economic values can be included in economic decision making processes. Three main alternatives are explored in terms of their advantages and disadvantages: cost-benefit analysis (CBA), multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA).","[Abson, David J.] Leuphana Univ, FuturES Res Ctr, Luneburg, Germany; [Pascual, Unai] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Bilbao, Spain; [Termansen, Mette] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Abson, DJ (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ, FuturES Res Ctr, Luneburg, Germany.",abson@leuphana.de; unai.pascual@bc3research.org; mter@dmu.dk,"Abson, David/AAE-9027-2019; Pascual, Unai/O-7946-2019; PASCUAL, UNAI/B-4766-2012","Pascual, Unai/0000-0002-5696-236X; PASCUAL, UNAI/0000-0002-5696-236X",,,,56,0,0,1,16,CABI PUBLISHING-C A B INT,WALLINGFORD,"CABI PUBLISHING, WALLINGFORD 0X10 8DE, OXON, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78064-532-2,SCOPE SER,,,2015,71,,,,,,214,223,,,,,10,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science",Geology; Agriculture,BC7XN,WOS:000355310900018,,,,,9/30/2020

The Ramsey equation for the discount rate has three components: the pure rate of time preference, a measure of relative risk aversion, and the rate of growth of per capita consumption. Much of the attention on the appropriate discount rate for long-term environmental problems has focussed on the role played by the pure rate of time preference in this formulation. We show that the other two elements are numerically just as important in considerations of anthropogenic climate change. The elasticity of the marginal utility with respect to consumption is particularly important because it assumes three roles: consumption smoothing over time, risk aversion, and inequity aversion. Given the large uncertainties about climate change and widely asymmetric impacts, the assumed rates of risk and inequity aversion can be expected to play significant roles. The consumption growth rate plays multiple roles, as well. It is one of the determinants of the discount rate, and one of the drivers of emissions and hence climate change. We also find that the impacts of climate change grow slower than income, so the effective discount rate is higher than the real discount rate. Moreover, the differential growth rate between rich and poor countries determines the time evolution of the size of the equity weights. As there are a number of crucial but uncertain parameters, it is no surprise that one can obtain almost any estimate of the social cost of carbon. We even show that, for a low pure rate of time preference, the estimate of the social cost of carbon is indeed arbitrary-as one can exclude neither large positive nor large negative impacts in the very long run. However, if we probabilistically constrain the parameters to values that are implied by observed behaviour, we find that the expected social cost of carbon, corrected for uncertainty and inequity, is approximate 60 US dollar per metric tonne of carbon (or roughly $17 per tonne of CO2) under the assumption that catastrophic risk is zero.

Even where agencies have relented in litigation or have proactively worked to integrate climate-change considerations into their NEPA documents, the factoring done has consigned those considerations to the margins. Impact assessment naturally does so. Every such action/assessment will involve what amounts to a drop in a bucket of contributory causes to a globally scaled, temporally remote catastrophe. Aggregative analyses minimize such contributions behind other, more proximate choice factors. A 2014 proposed guidance on climate change and NEPA from the Council on Environmental Quality ignored this fact. Likewise, the Office of Management and Budget's social cost of carbon estimates allow almost everything they inform to go forward essentially unchanged. This Article argues that a new approach is both urgently needed and feasible. The approach sketched here consists of the development of programmatic alternatives pursuant to NEPA 102(2)(E). This provision of the act requires all agencies to study and develop alternative uses of available resources, regardless of the magnitude or timing of their actions' marginal environmental impacts. This Article makes the case that our principal resource where climate change is concerned now is what remains of the planet's cycling and sinking capacities. If we are to pursue the mitigation goals the U.S. Government committed to in Paris in December, 2015, this approach is urgently needed. The steps outlined in Part V of this Article will help speed the U.S.'s development of mitigation options while avoiding some of the frictions other approaches entail.","[Colburn, Jamison E.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Colburn, Jamison E.] Penn State Univ, Law, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Colburn, JE (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Colburn, JE (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Law, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",,,,,,,154,0,0,1,4,UNIV ILLINOIS,CHAMPAIGN,"COLLEGE OF LAW-76 LAW BLDG 504 E PENNSYLVANIA AVE, CHAMPAIGN, IL 61820 USA",0276-9948,1942-9231,,U ILLINOIS LAW REV,Univ.

This paper aims to share information that will help develop a carbon tax policy in the Philippines. A face-to-face dichotomous choice, contingent valuation was conducted to elicit the willingness-to-pay of the respondents from 544 households in two localities namely Antipolo and Isabela, representing the urban and rural areas, respectively. Also, their knowledge, attitude, and practices towards climate change were surveyed. The information gathered is a primary step in identifying factors to consider in developing the carbon tax rate that will, be acceptable to the Filipino consumers. The data gathered in this study is limited to the imposition of carbon tax on the electricity and transportation sector the two sectors which contribute more than 50% of the Philippines' total carbon dioxide emission. The result of the survey showed a very low affirmation on the willingness-to-pay a carbon tax, not exceeding 50% of the total respondents, which may be attributed to the current social status of the Filipino people when most have yet to satisfy their basic needs. The respondents'. expenditure for the subject commodities sums to about 50% of their total monthly household's expenses (Antipolo: 13.06% of MHE is for electricity, 32.39% for fuel, and 10.37% for fare; Isabela: 13.60% of MHE is for electricity; 23.01% for fuel, and 9.24% for fare).","[Eleazar, Pamela Joyce M.] UPLB, Coll Dev Commun, College Los Banos 4030, Laguna, Philippines; [Demafelis, Rex B.; Matanguihan, Anna Elaine D.; Magadia, Bernadette D.

Unfortunately, we cannot wait for these uncertainties to be resolved before addressing the issue of climate change. Policymakers use two different strategies for setting climate policy in the face of this uncertainty: cost-benefit analysis and the precautionary principle. Although there has been much discussion of these strategies in the abstract, there has been less effort to assess them in operation. This Article analyzes these strategies and considers their application to climate risks in four case studies: detennination of the social cost of carbon, international endorsement of a 2 degrees C ceiling on warming, the Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding, and the polar bear listing decision. The precautionary principle requires that feasible steps be taken to control risks in the face of uncertainty. This proposal works well in determining whether to regulate, but gives limited guidance about the appropriate level of regulation. Cost-benefit analysis of climate change is designed to determine the level of regulation, but it also encounters difficulties. Cost-benefit analysts must quantify the harm created by carbon emissions, which can be difficult because of uncertainty about the extent of the impact. Economists are also unsure how to take into account the large time-scale of climate change. Thus both approaches have their problems in practice. There are some possible ways of combining economic analysis and the precautionary principle, but these have not yet been used in practice. In the meantime, the four case studies indicate that decision makers have managed to make reasonably defensible decisions despite the obstacles.","[Farber, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Farber, DA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,120,6,6,0,34,UNIV WASHINGTON SCHOOL OF LAW,SEATTLE,"WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW 1100 NE CAMPUS PARKWAY 410 CONDON HALL, SEATTLE, WA 98105 USA",0043-0617,,,WASH LAW REV,Wash.

On closer inspection, however, it is less clear what constitutes an optimal climate policy. This paper argues that optimality involves a range of criteria beyond short-term economic efficiency, but also has to consider the longer-term dynamic efficiency, as well as the political, administrative and legal feasibility of policy instruments. The assessment of optimality is confounded by the fact that climate policy relies on a number of policy instruments. This paper argues that a policy analysis should look at the performance of the entire instrument mix, and not analyse individual instruments in isolation. Such a mix will differ from country to country depending on political preferences, administrative capacities, or regulatory traditions. The mix is also evolving: as climate policy aims to transform entire economies, the impact of individual policy instruments in the climate policy mix grows measured by the share of the relevant markets that they affect, the incentives they provide, or the costs they impose. As this impact grows, there is increasing interaction between policy instruments. Understanding and managing these interactions therefore becomes key for successful climate policy. Emissions trading has a particular position in this instrument mix: it directly targets the end result, i.e. emissions from the regulated sectors, inputs to the process, technologies used, or the infrastructure, where other instruments target the interim stages in the process. At the same time, emissions trading also builds on other policies, for instance through administrative and regulatory infrastructures. This paper discusses how the other policy instruments affect the functioning of an emissions trading scheme (ETS), and how this will reflect on the performance of an ETS in terms of optimality.","Inst Ecol, D-10717 Berlin, Germany","Gorlach, B (corresponding author), Inst Ecol, Pfalzburger Str 43-44, D-10717 Berlin, Germany.",benjamin.goerlach@ecologic.eu,,,,,,41,4,4,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0958-305X,2048-4070,,ENERG ENVIRON-UK,Energy Environ.,,2014,25,4-Mar,,,SI,,733,749,,,,,17,Environmental Studies,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AI1UZ,WOS:000336642000011,,,,,9/30/2020

We used PAGE2002, the same probabilistic integrated assessment model as used by the Stem Review (Stem et al., 2006), to calculate the SCC and to examine how it varies with discount rate; and find that it is not sensitive to the path of emissions on which the tonne of carbon is superimposed. The mean value of the SCC is $43 per tonne under both a business-as-usual scenario, and under a scenario aimed at stabilizing CO2 concentrations at 550 ppm. This counter-intuitive result is caused by the interplay between the logarithmic relationship between forcing and concentration, the nonlinear relationship of damage to temperature, and discounting. However, the SCC is sensitive to a number of scientific and economic inputs to the model. Two recent distributions for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 (Murphy et al., 2004; Stainforth et al., 2005) increase the mean value of the SCC from $43 to $68 and $90 per tonne.

The regulatory activity so far has already set precedents on which future regulation will rest.

This Article examines the record of these agencies and criticizes the methods they have used to calculate the social cost of carbon emissions. We also develop a larger theme about the relationship between cost-benefit analysis and politics. The best case for cost-benefit analysis is that its recommendations are politically neutral in the sense of drawing on widely shared intuitions about human well-being. But cost-benefit analysis cannot cope with inherently political questions involving contested normative issues.

In Zero Zone, Inc. v. United States Department of Energy, the Seventh Circuit upheld the use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) when agencies consider GHG emissions in their cost-benefit analyses. At the same time, courts have almost uniformly rejected challenges that agencies should use the SCC when conducting environmental impact statements under NEPA on grounds that directly contradict the Seventh Circuit's reasoning. This disparate treatment is problematic: Because NEPA covers a broader category of federal actions than does the regulatory cost-benefit analysis mandate, agencies assess the environmental consequences of a significant number of federal actions without utilizing the SCC. This Note labels this chasm in the GHG reporting regime the CO2 monetization gap and examines the foreign-investment activities of the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) to demonstrate that it has contributed to poor decisionmaking. Ex-Im is a major financier of fossil fuel projects abroad and does not currently utilize the SCC in assessing the climate effects of its activities. Though Ex-Im's activities are justified on economic grounds, the benefits of the program are a mirage-when the SCC is applied to these activities, the economic benefits of the program largely disappear. This Note argues that integration of the SCC into the NEPA review process is both normatively desirable and legally feasible. It also addresses various strategies states may employ to mitigate the consequences of the CO2 monetization gap.","[Raduazo, Anthony R.] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA","Raduazo, AR (corresponding author), Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,63,0,0,0,0,COLUMBIA JOURNAL TRANSNATIONAL LAW ASSOC,NEW YORK,"COLUMBIA UNIV, SCHOOL LAW, 435 W 116TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA",0010-1958,1945-2268,,COLUMBIA LAW REV,Columbia Law Rev.,FEB,2018,118,2,,,,,605,651,,,,,47,Law,Government & Law,VJ0XF,WOS:000531497500007,,,,,9/30/2020

We develop a stochastic dynamic programming model of firm investment decisions that minimizes the expected present value of future power generation costs under uncertain natural gas and carbon prices. We explore the implications of regulatory uncertainty on generation technology choice and the optimal timing of investment, and assess the implications of these choices for regulators. We find that interaction of regulatory uncertainty with irreversible investment always raises the social cost of carbon abatement. Further, the social cost of regulatory uncertainty is strongly dependent on the relative competitiveness of IGCC plants, for which the cost of later carbon capture retrofits is comparatively small, and on the firm's ability to use investments in natural gas generation as a transitional strategy to manage carbon regulation uncertainty. Without highly competitive IGCC or low gas prices, regulatory uncertainty can increase the expected social cost of reducing emissions by 40 to 60%.","SUNY Coll Fredonia, Dept Econ, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA; Univ Calgary, Energy & Environm Syst Grp, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada","Reinelt, PS (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Fredonia, Dept Econ, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA.",reinelt@fredonia.edu; keith@ucalgary.ca,"Keith, David/E-9777-2010","Keith, David/0000-0002-8224-3780",,,,27,49,50,0,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2007,28,4,,,,,101,127,,,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,216DE,WOS:000249857400005,,,,,9/30/2020
J,"Revesz, RL",,,,"Revesz, Richard L.",,0,1,,Quantifying Regulatory Benefits,CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,COST; RISK; STRESS; HEALTH; LIFE,"This Essay makes three principal claims. First, it shows that breakeven analysis is a useful technique for adding structure to cost-benefit analysis when a regulatory benefit has not been quantified. In particular, breakeven analysis can sometimes address the judicial hostility to using nonquantified benefits as trumps. But it is a second-best approach because actually quantifying the benefit can provide far more useful information to the regulatory process. Second, the Essay argues that the categories of quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits are not immutable. Unquantifiable benefits are simply benefits that have not yet been quantified. Over the last few decades, important categories of benefits that were once considered unquantifiable were subsequently quantified: the two most significant for current regulatory purposes are the value of a statistical life (VSL) and the social cost of carbon (SCC). Third, the Essay shows that the federal government has played a significant role in providing resources for the quantification of important categories of benefits and should be regarded as a catalyst for future efforts of this sort. Recent congressional threats to cut the funding for research in the social sciences are a worrisome development in this regard. As a result, the push for breakeven analysis is a salutary development unless it diverts attention and resources from the actual quantification of regulatory benefits.","[Revesz, Richard L.] NYU, Sch Law, Law, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Revesz, Richard L.] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA","Revesz, RL (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Law, Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,Filomen D'Agostino and Max Greenberg Research Fund at the New York University School of Law,"Lawrence King Professor of Law and Dean Emeritus, New York University School of Law.

This is a startling divergence from traditional regulatory practice, which had been to entirely exclude foreign impacts from domestic regulatory analysis. Even more strikingly, this significant shift in valuation practice has occurred with virtually no legal analysis as to when or whether agencies have the statutory authority to consider foreign impacts. As a result, a number of recent rules proposed on the basis of a globally scoped Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) are now vulnerable to legal challenge. To insulate future rules against such challenges, agencies should adopt the globally scoped SCC only where they have performed individualized, statute-specific analyses of their own authority to incorporate foreign impacts into their decisions.","[Rowell, Arden] Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Chicago, IL 60680 USA","Rowell, A (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",,,"Rowell, Kristen/0000-0003-3112-755X",,,,68,7,7,0,0,HARVARD LAW SCHOOL,CAMBRIDGE,"PUBLICATIONS CTR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",0147-8257,,,HARVARD ENVIRON LAW,Harv.

Therefore, this research paper investigates the effect of carbon prices adequate to the estimated social costs of carbon emissions on European electricity spot markets by applying the unit commitment model MICOES-Europe for the year 2030. The results show that adequate carbon pricing is an effective measure to reach significant emission reductions with in the power sector through fuel switching from coal to gas. Moreover, the impact of the fuel-switch on emission reductions is highly dependent on the initial relationship of fuel prices for gas and coal given low carbon prices. Conversely the dependency decreases with higher carbon prices. Overall, the marginal benefit of ambitious carbon prices is capped by the capacity utilization of gas-fired power plants. The rate of additional emission mitigation is highest at carbon prices in the range between 50-100 (sic)/tCO(2), an increase beyond 150 (sic)/tCO(2) results in minor further emission reductions.","[Scheller, F.; Alkhatib, H.; Kondziella, H.; Graupner, S.; Bruckner, T.] Univ Leipzig, IIRM, Leipzig, Germany","Scheller, F (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, IIRM, Leipzig, Germany.",scheller@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research with the project H2Flex of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy [03ZZ0740A]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research with the project WindNODE of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy [03SIN540],This research has been partially funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research with the project H2Flex (03ZZ0740A) and WindNODE (03SIN540) of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy.,,23,0,0,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2165-4077,,978-1-7281-1257-2,INT CONF EUR ENERG,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Energy & Fuels; Engineering,BO6MY,WOS:000521338300036,,,,,9/30/2020

This Note analyzes two precedents the 2013 SCC revision process set: (I) an agency will not re-notice a proposed rule when it substitutes an old SCC with a revised SCC in the final rule; and (2) the interagency working group that calculates the SCC will not submit revised SCCs for independent notice and comment. This Note argues that these precedents, although likely permitted under present judicial interpretations of the APA, contribute to an uncertain regulatory environment for industries subject to carbon emissions regulation. This Note recommends that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a member of the interagency working group as well as the hub of executive oversight of the rulemaking process, should communicate more clearly and transparently about the SCC revision process, using the Federal Reserve System's forward guidance communications strategy as a model.","Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Stirling, JG (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",,,,,,,0,1,1,0,0,"UNIV IOWA, COLL LAW",IOWA CITY,"290 BOYD LAW BLDG, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA",0021-0552,,,IOWA LAW REV,Iowa Law Rev.,JAN,2015,100,2,,,,,853,880,,,,,28,Law,Government & Law,AY7SQ,WOS:000347759600012,,,,,9/30/2020

This model was further used to calculate the optimal carbon tax rate and optimal government subsidy level for both traditional electric power enterprises and new energy enterprises. The results showed that a reasonable carbon tax rate and return mode can optimize the structure of Chinese power industry, encouraging the high-carbon enterprises to reduce emission, promote the development of low carbon enterprises, and reduce the overall carbon dioxide emission from the power industry.","[Tang Qi] Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tang Qi] Zaoyang 2 High Sch, Zaoyang, Hubei, Peoples R China",,498007504@qq.com,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,UNIV CALGARY PRESS,CALGARY,"2500 UNIV DR NW, CALGARY, AB T2N 1N4, CANADA",,,978-0-88953-398-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,465,472,,,,,8,"Business; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications",Business & Economics; Computer Science,BI4ZQ,WOS:000412149300051,,,,,9/30/2020

Estimates of SCC are produced using integrated assessment models (IAMs) in which simplified models of the global climate system are in feedback connection with highly stylized models of global economic behavior. Approaches to optimal emissions reduction pathways are conventionally based on solutions to open-loop optimal control problems, which do not easily accommodate key uncertainties in the dynamic response of the climatic and economic sub-systems. In this paper we develop a receding horizon implementation of DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy), the most widely used IAM. We use this receding horizon control framework to compute the social cost of carbon in the presence of uncertainty in CO 2 emissions and measurements of global mean surface temperature, and to investigate the effect on the SCC of a hard constraint limiting global temperature rise to no more than 2 degrees C over pre-industrial levels.","[Weller, Steven R.; Hafeez, Salman; Kellett, Christopher M.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia","Weller, SR (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",steven.weller@newcastle.edu.au; salman.hafeez@uon.edu.au; chris.kellett@newcastle.edu.au,"Kellett, Christopher M/C-1815-2008","Kellett, Christopher M/0000-0002-8309-6807",,,,32,4,4,0,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",0743-1546,,978-1-4799-7886-1,IEEE DECIS CONTR P,,,2015,,,,,,,5384,5390,,,,,7,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Automation & Control Systems; Engineering,BF4PY,WOS:000381554505093,,,,,9/30/2020
