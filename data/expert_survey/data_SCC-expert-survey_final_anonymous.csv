What is required is a presentation of the range of what is known, coupled with some decision / welfare theoretical approach to assess what the welfare maximisng approach is when faced with such dramatic uncertainties (a la Barro, Weitzman etc.). recent work by Dietz et al (2021) tends to indicate that tipping points will be trivial in terms of impact on GDP due to physial factors (e.g. feedbacks) but also economic factors (discounting, damage function and the fact that an optimal path will reduce the risks considerably) .

I decided in each case what I guessed you might be after, and I did not represent the literature per se but that part of the literature corresponding to my guess of what you might be after.","E.g. growth change: even the DICE model has a pass through of the damages on the capital stock (so yes, agree, important), but I assumed you are likely after assuming direct damages on the growth rate rather than output or capital stock (then answer is, no, disagree that it improves the estimates conditional on current knowledge).

My reasons are the following.  Economists are quick to dismiss the benefits of CO2 fertilization.  Economists tend to also dismiss future adaptation.  Many economists do not realize tipping points are already part of traditional damage estimates.  Some economists are reaching for damages that are likely to be small in the labor market, with conflict, from migration, and ecosystem change. Finally, my colleagues are a little confused about the endogeneity of the SCC.  If society adopts a high SCC, there will be a lot of mitigation.  This will lower the SCC.  They should not be calculating an SCC based on Business as Usual unless they believe the SCC will have and should have no effect on policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorry for that. Actually, I am now more convinced that the SCC is not helping us and that the cost-benefit analysis of climate change has caused more confusion to the decision-makers that benefit. When Nordhaus obtained the Nobel prize in 2018 the committee included a figure with an ""optimal"" stabilization temperature of 3C..., something that any IPCC report would endorse. With all my respect, I think the economic methods have been pushed too far in relation to what our data, models and projections and knowledge can really say and not. I have personally worked with the DICE model in the past and I know how sensible it is to small variations to few parameters and on the damage function selected. For that reason, I cannot respond. It can be 10 or it can be 10.000. I dont know. I am not trying to deviate you from your plans or to argue on this (I might be wrong), but as I have received the mail 4 times, I had the necessity to explain to you why I cannot respond. Of course, I think we need to devote more efforts on putting monetary values to the damage (present and future) of climate change where we have information and keep on with the carbon pricing/markets. Also, if we need a reference-value for guiding decision-makers, I think that the cost of abatement (for example to achieve the Paris Agreement targets) can be a good reference-point as we have less uncertainty on some key technologies. Of course, this is my point of view.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope it is ok if I pass on filling in the form. As you probably know, I am not enthusiastic about using IAMs as the basis for calculating social cost of carbon or indeed as a basis for public policy in general. A challenge is to change the structures of economies fundamentally and rapidly. As I have argued, I think we should approach shadow pricing for carbon in a way which helps directly with that question and thus asking what are the prices that, when combined with other structural polices, help make this transformation happen. I fear that the process you are embarking might keep IAMs at centre stage when they really dont capture the urgent and major policy questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
